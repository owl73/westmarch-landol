# Welcome

300 years have passed since the western annex was brought to an end by the
eastern conflict.  During the 300 years since, the newly settled lands were cut
off from usual supplies and communication ceased.  Now with the eastern
conflict over for now, the west again becomes a prize.  Wealth of the 300 years
since are free for the taking, and lands free to claim.  Adventurers, enticed
by the past's treasures, are drawn by the from within the kingdom and beyond by
the promise of the wonder of what was lost and what lies beyond.

# Leathality

This kind of play is known for being more leathal to the point of character
grinders.
That is only partly true. 
This assuption comes from the fact that the danger is more real.
This style of play is more player driven.
A DM (me) will no longer see tailor each encounter to strength of the party.
Opposed to engineering each encounter in the effort to make a story that I have
planned out ahead of time. 
There isn't any pulling punches, or encounter balance. 
The encounters are what they are. 
Difficulty won't decrease because you made a mistake, and it won't increase
because you planned ahead. 
The DM is rooting for you.
But the DM's job is to make a realistic (fantasy) world, and the world is
against you.

# Rules

The core mechanics are static with respect to the story. 
They will only change for a very good reason.

The classes and other rules are incomplete.
Go explore. It might change the game.

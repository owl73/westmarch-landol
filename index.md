# Into the Unknown

***Three centuries before, the western annex was brought to an end.
The Eastern Conflict was deemed more important.
During the 300 years since, the newly settled lands were cut off. 
Supply lines and communication ceased.***

***Now, with the eastern conflict over for now, the west again becomes a prize.
Wealth of the ancients are free for the taking, and lands free to claim.***

***Adventurers, enticed by the past's treasures, are drawn by the from within 
the kingdom of Landol and beyond by the promise of the wonder 
of what was lost and what lies beyond.***

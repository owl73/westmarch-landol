# Into the Unknown

***300 years have passed since the western annex was brought to an end by the
eastern conflict.  During the 300 years since, the newly settled lands were cut
off from usual supplies and communication ceased.  Now with the eastern
conflict over for now, the west again becomes a prize.  Wealth of the 300 years
since are free for the taking, and lands free to claim.  Adventurers, enticed
by the past's treasures, are drawn by the from within the kingdom and beyond by
the promise of the wonder of what was lost and what lies beyond.***

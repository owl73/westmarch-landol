***After 300 years, The Eastern Conflict over for now, 
the Western Lands again become a prize.***

***Wealth of the ancients are free for the taking, and lands free to claim.
Or are they?***

***Adventurers, enticed by the treasures of the past, are drawn from within 
the kingdom of Landol and beyond by the promise of the wonder 
of what was lost and what lies beyond.***

***The Angstrom Sword! 
Metri's lore! 
Knowledge of the Vat person! 
The Tales of Old can again be discovered!***

***But Adventurers Beware! Many Things lurk in The Unknown. 
Echos of the past, and monsters sealed
away. Beware The Golem, The Sisters, and the one named Nekus.***

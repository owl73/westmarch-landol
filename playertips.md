# Rules

The core mechanics are static with respect to the story. 
They will only change for a very good reason.

The classes and other rules are incomplete.
Go explore. It might change the game. 

# Leathality

This kind of play is known for being more leathal to the point of character
grinders.
That is only partly true. 
This assuption comes from the fact that the danger is more real.
This style of play is more player driven.
A DM (me) will no longer see tailor each encounter to strength of the party.
Opposed to engineering each encounter in the effort to make a story that I have
planned out ahead of time. 
There isn't any pulling punches, or encounter balance. 
The encounters are what they are. 
Difficulty won't decrease because you made a mistake, and it won't increase
because you planned ahead. 
The DM is rooting for you.
But the DM's job is to make a realistic (fantasy) world, and the world is
against you.

## Learn When To Run

Old school adventures often present
deadly encounters that, to the eye of a
modern gamer, may seem like you’re
expected to beat them. Learn to dig into
the fiction to see the relative power of
what you're facing, and don't be afraid
to cut your losses. A party that drags
away one dead body is a party on their
way to a Cleric, instead of on their way
through a monster's digestive system.

## Combat As War, Not Sport

Don’t expect encounters to be
“balanced”. Approach combat with as
much trepidation and preparation as
you would in real life. Nor are
encounters self-contained. Think
outside the box, outside the encounter
area, outside the dungeon. Think like
Sun Tzu. Think laterally or die.

# Don’t Be Limited By Your Character Sheet

Rules and mechanics are only
triggered by what happens as
established in the conversational fiction
of play. To do something, describe your
character doing it; if you need to roll
dice, the GM will let you know.

When presented with a problem,
don't expect to “use” your character’s
skills or abilities on it; investigate it by
asking the GM questions and describing
what your character tries.

Don’t worry much about low stats, or
roleplaying to match them. If they’re
low, it just means you’ll have to be
clever, gather information, and plan
ahead to avoid dangerous rolls! Or forge
ahead, foolhardy, and look forward to
rolling up a new character.

# Live Your Backstory

Don’t put much work into a backstory
for your characters. Their experiences
in play will be more real to you and your
friends than anything you write. An
early death won’t sting quite as much,
and a survivor will have real tales to tell,
and experience to take pride in.

# Power Is Earned, Heroism Proven

Unlike many modern RPGs, your
character starts with little power. Your
meager means and abilities at first level
encourage lateral thinking to get you
out of trouble. Rising to a challenge (or
fleeing it) means more when their life is
on the line.
Likewise, if you wish to play a true
hero, don’t expect anyone to salute you
when you first ride into town. Prove
your heroism through your character’s
actions.

# Scrutinize The World

Discard any assumptions about other
fantasy worlds, and be curious about
the one you’re playing in. Pay attention
to details—about characters, the
environment, social situations, and
more. Take notes on them! Make maps
of them! Information is leverage, my
crafty friend. Those details can save
your life.
Interrogate The Fiction
If you were in a room with a heavy
vase in one corner, and you wanted to
know what was behind it, what would
you do? Probably drag it to the side,

right? Looking for an air current? Lick a
finger and hold it up. Judging the slope
of a floor? Spill a little water on the
ground. Engage the fiction of the game
world as real. Describe the real actions
you take to achieve the effect you're
looking for. Remember, other games
may have dice rolls to do this for you
—many old school games don't, so
engage!

# The Only Dead End Is Death
That dead-end hallway may hide a
secret door, or maybe there's another
passage to investigate. The gargantuan
monstrosity in the courtyard? Maybe
you can get around it, or negotiate. A
recalcitrant noble? Maybe someone
knows how to get some leverage.
Couldn't pick that iron door? Maybe one
of those unidentified potions will help.
Old school games have lots of hard
blockers. When your first attempt fails,
change tactics—the dead end is just the
beginning of your solution. Often,
digging into the fiction and engaging
the world as real will open up new and
unexpected avenues.

# Let Your Creativity Flow
Your class and/or race can do some
unique things the other folks can't.
Learn to recognize when it's your turn
to shine, and when it's someone else's.
When it's your turn, really go for it.
Outside of the game mechanics of your
character, what are your unique
inspirations and ideas? Do you see a
clever use for a magic item? Do you
want to try negotiating with the
ferocious monster? Do you see a
weakness in the defenses the others
don't immediately recognize? Could you
combine a few of these opportunities in
a unique way? Open up your brain, and
let in the weird and the creative. The
world is so bizarre... it just might work.

# Play To Win, Savor Loss
Everyone wants to succeed, and
certainly everyone wants to play with
friends they feel are aiming to succeed
—but that may not always happen. Your
characters may get turned into frog-
people, lose limbs, be stricken by
leprosy, turned into stone, cursed to
burp up slugs, entombed in the earth for
10,000 years, or just die from being
stabbed in the gut by a farmer with a
pitchfork. Learn to love the disgusting,
horrifying, shocking, surprising, and
even disappointing ways your
characters are set back.

And remember, through play, a story
emerges larger than any one character.
You will make your mark on the world,
be it an unknowingly misleading arrow
scratched into a dungeon wall, or a
crater where a city once stood.

# Setup 

Every adventure will start and end in Westford. 
Westford is a quiet town and no adventures will ever take place there. 
All the adventure is in exploring. 

You might want to maintain a map of whats out there.

### Starting Your journey

Many townsfolk hear rumors of happenings in the west. 
What of the dwarves? Were the wild elves? The king of the forest?
Flowered warriors? 

Ask around you might find a bit of info and give you leads on where you could
go. 

You can also just leave. There is more information outside of town than in it. 
Establishing contacts outside of town could be crucial. 

### Adventuring 

You will travel out west and encounter things along the way. 

It is dangerous out there. 
Be prepared. 

### Goals 

The idea is to explore. It helps if your character, or you personally, have a
goal in mind. It might be hard to find a goal without info of whats out there
so check the setting page for rumors, or
give it a session and it might spark something.

# Westford and Beyond

You live in Westford, 
the town furthest west in the Landol Kingdom. 
Beyond you is open wilderness.

It was not always that way. 
Centuries ago your kingdom conquered and established the land. 
But the Eastern Conflict tore Landol away from the west, 
and the land was lost. 

It festered for 300 years.

### Setup

Every adventure will start and end in Westford. 
Westford is a quiet town and no adventures will ever take place there. 
All the adventure is in exploring. 

You might want to maintain a map of whats out there.

### Starting Your journey

Many townsfolk hear rumors of happenings in the west. 
What of the dwarves? Were the wild elves? The king of the forest?
Flowered warriors? 

Ask around you might find a bit of info and give you leads on where you could
go.

### Adventuring 

You will travel out west and encounter things along the way. 

It is dangerous out there. 
Be prepared. 

### Goals 

The idea is to explore. It helps if your character, or you personally, have a
goal in mind. It might be hard to find a goal without info of whats out there
but give it a session and it might spark something.

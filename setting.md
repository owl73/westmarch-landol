# Westford and Beyond

You live in Westford, 
the town furthest west in the Landol Kingdom. 
Beyond you is open wilderness.

It was not always that way. 
Centuries ago your kingdom conquered and established the land. 
But the Eastern Conflict tore Landol away from the west, 
and the land was lost. 

It festered for 300 years.

## Rumors

Greg, the inn keeper:

*The Flylings in the forest are becomeing more active and started hireing
mercenaries. Sounds rotten to me.*

*The bandits in the plains to the west have been growing. They say a traitor
Knight named Tarion leads them with the help of his great riches.*

*They say a dwarf lives at the foot of the mountains allong the river. I think
its a bloody lie. But who knows, if he's real, I'd love to buy magic from him.*


## Legends

### Knights of Flowers

Once roaming the land with their namesake pinned to their chest, they were
kights of magic and secrets. They fought with grace, beauty, and powers
unknown. All that remains of them are their flowery graves, and the persisting
magic of their ways. 

### Dragons

Some say they've seen them. Others say they met some. The latter lie. Those
that know the true terror and beauty of a dragon never survive. Asside from one
man, the weilder of *Dragon Fang*. 

### Dwarves

Crafters of Magic. Knowers of lore. None have seen them in hundreds of
years. They have gone, but their cities beneath the mountains remain. 
What, or who, have they left behind?

### The Necromancer

Ridiculed for his work, he went west for solitude. Signs of him have appeared.
Undead, organized, cruel. Different from the cursed souls of the earth, wander
in his service. Beware the undead with minds, gifted by a creator. He has
secrets and treasure taboo.

### The Reaper

Tales of the Reaper are few, but the rare survivors of this entity tell tales
of everlasting life, and of cold lands. 

### Fairy Queen

Beyond the mountains lies the fairies. 
In a forest graceful and strange and cruel. 
Much like their queen herself. 
She is known as a wishgiver, but not without trade.

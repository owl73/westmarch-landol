# Inner Circles

After completing all the templates of one class, a character can then start
making their own Inner Circle. 

An inner circle is an organization made up of player characters with one or 
more characters serving as Heads. 

The character who achieves the template for an Inner Circle gains their own
domain of some sort of home base. This character becomes the Head of the inner
circle. The members of the inner circle increase the resources available to it. 
Through the Inner Circle a player may pull resources at the start of the game
during rumors or during gameplay. 

The player of the Head of the circle as well as all players in the same
party can choose for their characters to become members of this Inner Circle.

  - Network

  - Hirelings 

### Base of Operation

Whenever it is convienent for a player they can find their character there.

The location can be taken full advantage of by any player character. 

This base of Operation is operated by the Head of this Circle 

### Steady Income

A steady income of 50gold per week is earned by the head by operating the base.
You lose this income if the Head is adventuring at all during the week.

# Example
The effects are cumulative. If a PC with -8 HP and no current
Injuries rolls a 10 on a d12, to the leg, X = 10+8+0 = 18. They
gain 4 Fatal Wounds, the leg is Mangled, and also Disabled for
18 days.
If they took a further 1 point of damage (-9 HP), they would roll
1d12 + 9 (Lethal Damage) + 1 (Mangled) + 1 (Disabled) for
1d12+11.

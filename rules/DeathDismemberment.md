## Fatal Wounds
A PC has 3 rounds to clear all their Fatal Wounds or they die. They can attempt
to remove a Fatal Wound on their turn by rolling 1 on a d6. PCs with Fatal
Wounds are unconscious. This does not mean they are quiet or asleep (they can
be screaming and holding a stump), but it means they cannot take conscious or
deliberate actions. Remove oldest Fatal Wounds first. You may want to use
different coloured d6s to represent Fatal Wounds acquired on different rounds.
Up to two adjacent allies can try to remove Fatal Wounds from a dying character
by spending their turn doctoring the wounded PC and then rolling under ½
Intelligence (unless they have a useful skill).

### Interesting Scars
The scar must be a mangled, twisted, gnarled thing, a worm of �esh
buried
under the skin. It provies a +2 bonus to Charisma while interacting
with people
who appreciate a good scar and a good story (barbarians,
barber-surgeons,
knights, suitors, poets, etc.)

# Example 
The effects are cumulative. If a PC with -8 HP and no current
Injuries rolls a 10 on a d12, to the leg, X = 10+8+0 = 18. They
gain 4 Fatal Wounds, the leg is Mangled, and also Disabled for
18 days.
If they took a further 1 point of damage (-9 HP), they would roll
1d12 + 9 (Lethal Damage) + 1 (Mangled) + 1 (Disabled) for
1d12+11.

# Spells


Spells are living creatures. Spells, enchantments, ghosts, and
souls are all more or less the same. A wizard's spells range in
intelligence from pond scum to ferrets. A spellbook is a
menagerie-prison. A well-trained brain is a mind-gun loaded with
spell-bullets. Minor spells, called cantrips, infest a wizard's soul
and bind to it. 

Many wizards hold libraries full of spells and move them about or memorize them
when needed. Others trade spells for ones they need. Some will attempt to breed
a spell perfect for the task they require. Some seek to slay other wizards in 
duels to take their best spells. There are spells all over nature
from enchantments bound to them by wizards. Some seek them out, others seek to
add to them. 

## Storing

It takes 10min to move a spell between
a spell slot in your brain and a spellbook, scroll, or wand.
One spell fits in a scroll, wand or page (1/10th) of a spellbook.
How many spells you can handle in your mind depends on your training and
practice.

## Casting

#### Head
To cast a spell, select a number of Magic Dice (MD) you wish to
invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. 
Most spells depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum] they show. 
*Doubles* generate Mishaps and the spell is used for the day;
**Triples** generate Dooms and kill the spell in the process. 

Dice that roll 1-3 return to your casting pool and can be used
again that day. Dice that roll 4-6 are removed from your casting
pool for the day. Your spells return at sunrise to last location they
were imprisoned, when the octarine light of the sun touches the
world and infuses Creation with an extra boost of raw magic.
Your MD return if you get a good night's sleep. If you didn't sleep
well, you can Save for each MD to have them return to your pool
anyway.

#### Scroll 
Casting a spell from a scroll provides +1 MD as the scroll burns 
and the additional MD is expended.
This allows characters without magic to cast spells. 

#### Wand
A wand grants stores a spell as if it was in your head. It effectively add 1
extra spell for a wizard.

#### Spellbook
Each page in a spellbook acts identically to a scroll. A page burns as a scroll
would upon casting. 


### Book casting
Some can cast scrolls without burning it. 

By doing this, you forfeit the extra die provided by the scroll or spellbook
and instead use your own MD, preserving the scroll or page in the process, but
the spell is ejected, returning at dawn.

## Breeding

With the help of a wizard's lab, you can breed 2 spells. A third spell results,
often being one of the 2 first spells or some combination of the two. Mutations
can occur. 

## Mutating

Some spells are born mutated, some can be mutated after creation. 
Mutations often add some benefit or some drawback to the spell. 

## Enchantments

Spell duration lasts for minutes, or rounds. 
However, a caster can bind it to an external process enchanting that thing. 
Or they can define some condition upon the ending of the spell, if cast well
enough. 

### Binding 

To Enchant an object or process and bind a spell to it, the spell must be cast
at the time of object's or process's inception. Afterwards the spell and the
process are now one, it cannot be cast again before it ends. 
There must be sufficent involvement from the caster in the inception of the
process, and in some cases, involvement in the process itself. 
Wizards have gone many years searching for the rules governing the rules of
enchantment but, few have made progress. 
Some are naturals, some struggle even with candles. 
The most talented of wizards seek the birth of ancient beasts,
objects, or natural processes to enchant, binding their most powerful spells.

Examples:

- Light a candle while binding *levitate*, and it lasts until the candle goes
  out. 

- Enchant a cat's life when it is born with the spell *friends* making it
  your familiar until it dies. 

- Bind a spell to an egg to enchant the chicken, making a spell last as long as
  the chicken is alive. 

### Triggered release

A spell cast with enough power can be cast with a condition of it's end. The
number of conditions specified is the MD-2 used to cast it (at least 3MD is
required). Some wizards that stuggle with binding make use of these
instead. 

To make a condition, sufficient ritualistic materials are required. Enough to
fully represent the condition named. 

Examples:

- A wizard may cast *sleep* setting the condition of waking being the ringing
  of a silver bell. This could be done by ringing and quickly quieting such a
  bell during casting, and leaving the bell in the sleeper's possession.

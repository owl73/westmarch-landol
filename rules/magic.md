# Magic

*A spell is a will*
*Commitment is its strength*
*And cyclus is its link to the world*

### What is a spell

A spell is a spirit, a will, an entity waiting to be born. The casting of a
spell is what gives it life, and it's *cyclus* is what determines its age and
death. 

A wizard collects spells and stores them for later casting. Most often in a
spell book. 

A spell can be copied. But not without risk. Neither is copying a pure art. The
act of copying a spell can result in changing or losing the copy, the original, 
or - in the worst of cases - injury to the copier. 

### Casting

Casting a spell requires both binding it to some 
cycle as well as investing some strength in the spell. 

At the casting of a spell, a cycle is begun and bound to the spell as well as 
some strength of magic being commited to it. 
The spell then persists for as long as the cycle is incomplete, determining the
life of the spell or *cyclus* as it is known to the wizards. 
The commitment of magic determines the force of the spell. 

A *cyclus* for a spell can be almost anything. For instance, the light of a
candle, a breath, a song, a day, the life of an animal or plant, the life of a
object, wearing a piece of clothing, or the passage of the sun. Anything that
has a begining and an end. To bind the spell to its *cyclus* the spell must be
joined at the beginning of the cycle. This requires the wizard to have some
part in the creation of the cycle, or at least interact with the cycle's birth.
The spell is initiated and perseists for as long as the *cyclus* continues. 

The magic commitment to a spell is one of spiritual nature. As a wizard grows
in power so does their strength of magic. The binding of the spell to its
*cyclus* is the moment in which the magic must be invested.

A spell cannot be cast twice. While the spell is bound to its own *cyclos* it
is still ongoing, and cannot be used again. Once the *cyclos* ends, the spell
dies and is lost. 

### Magical Power

A wizard has some magic or spiritual strength. Much like real strength and
skill it can be improved. The might of a wizard increases as they level. 

The strength is represented with "magic dice", refered to as MD. A magic die
(MD) is a d6. They are invested in a spell during casting at the beginning of
the *cyclus*. The MD are rolled to see how powerful the spell is. The more dice
invested and the higher the total sum, the stronger the spell. The MD is
commited to the spell and don't return until the *cyclus* has ended.

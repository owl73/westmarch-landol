# Exploration

# Wilderness

Time is tracked in 6 hour Watch.

During a watch you can

- Travel
- Search the area
- Rest / Camp

After traveling for 6h on foot, you exhaust you 1 inventory slot. 
Roads let you travel twice as fast. 
Mounts let you travel an extra 6h without before exhausting an inventory slot.
You can gain them back by resting.

While traveling and searching you might encounter things living out there. 
Camping is safer, but not completely.


For each watch, the DM rolls an encounter die

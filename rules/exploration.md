Time is tracked in 8 hour blocks

During 8 hours you can

- Travel
- Search the area
- Rest / Camp

After traveling for 8h on foot, you exhaust you 1 inventory slot. 
Roads let you travel twice as fast. 
Mounts let you travel an extra 8h without before exhausting an inventory slot.
You can gain them back by resting.

While traveling and searching you might encounter things living out there. 
Camping is safer, but not completely.


For each 8 hour block, the DM rolls an encounter die

# Combat

No one likes waiting for their turns.
Lets speed this up.

During comabat time is measured in rounds. Each round is a few seconds. 

## Reactions 

When you meet someone, combat doesn't just start. 
The GM will roll a reaction roll for the other creature using the charisma
bonus of the most visible character.

*2d6 + Cha bns.*

2d6+ | Result | Notes
2 or less | Immediate Attack | Offended or disgusted.
3-5 | Unfavourable | May attack if victory likely.
6-8 | Unsure | Cautionary or suspicious
9-11 | Favourable | Parley or bargaining.
12 or more  | Very Favourable | May choose to cooperate.

## Combat Begins

### Steps (subject to change based on player preference)

0. Initiative 
    1d6 : 1-3 enemies first (some player bonuses may apply)

1. Action Decisions (5s per player)
    Everyone decides what action they are doing
    (In opposite order of initiative)
2. roll (5s for everyone)
    Everyone rolls for success 
3. Resolution 
    The actions resolve in order of initiative
4. Finish round
    - Morale (if applicable)
    - Other effects...
    - Spells go off
    - Go to step 1
    - Combat over?

### Initiative 
d6
3 or less: enemies resolve first
4 or more: players resolve first

Surprise and/or initiative will usually be decided by who is aware of each
other at beginning of combat. 
If a side is surprised the other gets to act 1 full round before initiative
is rolled.
In the event of neither players or enemies are aware,
either the dice decide or both are surprised.

## Actions in combat

A PC or enemy can do one of the following:

+ Make an Attack roll against a target.
+ Move from one area to another.
+ Cast a spell or activate a magic item.
+ Retrieve an item from a non-quickdraw slot.
+ Reload a crossbow, etc.
+ Try a manuver, such as trip, shove, or push a target.
+ Attempt to [remove a Fatal Wound](DeathDismemberment.md#fatal-wounds) from a dying ally.

Talking, shouting, or dropping an item can be done freely, and
possibly even in other peoplesâ€™ turns. Basically, you can do one
big thing a turn, plus move a bit.
Players should note.
Monsters may telegraph attacks if players have initiative.
You cannot use ranged attacks when engaged in melee.
A spell will fail and mishap if you're damaged while casting.

### Resolution
If an enemy has initiative, you might die before that strike!

### Attack
Roll under or equal to your attack stat. (Nat 1 is crit, nat 20 is a fail)
If there is a success, the player rolls the damage of their weapon
and the enemy takes that damage.

#### Ranged Attacks

Every time you roll a ranged attack roll a 1d8. If you roll a 1 put an X next
to an ammo slot. At 3 Xs the slot is used up and you have no more ammunition.
(slings can be replenished out of combat if you have rocks around you.)

### Defense
If an enemy attacks you, roll under Defense or get hit. 

### Manuver
Make a relavent stat check to succeed. 
If it is against an enemy, such as trip or push, you might have a penalty if
they are extra strong or agile. 

### Morale
All NPCs have a morale score from 2 to 12 (monsters, hirelings etc.).  
When their morale is tested they get a 2d6 roll.  
If their roll beats their morale they will flee. 

### Combat advantage
2d20 take the best roll (or +4 to stat). 
This can be gained through ANY tactical advantage.
Examples include attacking an unaware enemy, higher ground, unbalance. 
This may be rewarded without the player asking, but only on rare occasions.
The player must be actively looking for advantage to gain it.

### Crits
A natural 1 is a hit, and damages the armor of the defender, also automatic
maximum damage.
A natural 20 is a miss, and damages the weapon of the attacker. 

## [Hit points](stats.md#hit-points)

"Don't Get hit points"
If you are at 0 or more you're fine.
Negatives? Then we have a problem.
See the [death and dismemberment table](DeathDismemberment.md)

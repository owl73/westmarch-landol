# Combat

No one likes waiting for their turns.
Lets speed this up.

## Reactions 

When you meet someone, combat doesn't just start. 
The GM will roll a reaction roll for the other creature using the charisma
bonus of the most visible character.

*2d6 + Cha bns.*

2d6+ | Result | Notes
2 or less | Immediate Attack | Offended or disgusted.
3-7 | Unfavourable | May attack if victory likely.
8-11 | Favourable | Parley or bargaining.
12 or more  | Very Favourable | May choose to cooperate.

## Combat Begins

### Steps (subject to change based on player preference)

0. Initiative 
    1d6 : 1-3 enemies first (some player bonuses may apply)

1. Action Decisions (5s per player)
    Everyone decides what action they are doing
    (In opposite order of initiative)
2. roll (5s for everyone)
    Everyone rolls for success 
3. Resolution 
    The actions resolve in order of initiative
4. Other 
    - Morale (if applicable)
    - Other effects...
    - Spells?
    - Go to step 1

### Initiative 
d6
3 or less: enemies resolve first
4 or more: players resolve first

Surprise and/or initiative will usually be decided by who is aware of each
other at beginning of combat. 
If a side is surprised the other gets to act 1 full round before initiative
is rolled.
In the event of neither players or enemies are aware,
either the dice decide or both are surprised.

## Actions in combat
On Their Turn
A PC or enemy can do one of the following:
+ Make an Attack roll against a target.
+ Run about 50’+Movement (or 60’).
+ Make a charge attack against a target (Move
    20’+Movement and then make an Attack roll).
+ Cast a spell or activate a magic item.
+ Retrieve an item from a non-quickdraw slot.
+ Reload a crossbow, etc.
+ Try to trip, shove, or push a target.
+ Attempt to remove a Fatal Wound from a dying ally.

In addition, a PC or enemy can move 20’+Movement (or 30’).
Talking, shouting, or dropping an item can be done freely, and
possibly even in other peoples’ turns. Basically, you can do one
big thing a turn, plus move a bit.
Players should note.
Monsters may telegraph attacks if players have initiative.
You cannot use ranged attacks when engaged in melee.
A spell will fail and mishap if you're damaged while casting.

## Resolution
If an enemy has initiative, you might die before that strike!

## Attack
Roll attack (d20 + attack) vs monster's defense. (Natural 20 is a crit)
If there is a success, the player rolls the damage of their weapon
and the enemy takes that damage.

## Defense
Monster attacks vs player defence 
(I want to streamline monster attack so players aren't waiting while others get
hit, I have to figure that out first) 

## Morale
All NPCs have a morale score from 2 to 12 (monsters, hirelings etc.).  
When their morale is tested they get a 2d6 roll.  
If their roll beats their morale they will flee. 

## Combat advantage
2d20 take the best roll (or +4). 
This can be gained through ANY tactical advantage.
Examples include attacking an unaware enemy, higher ground, unbalance. 
This may be rewarded without the player asking, but only on rare occasions.
The player must be actively looking for advantage to gain it.

## Crits
A natural 20 is a hit, and damages the armor of the defender, also automatic
maximum damage.
A natural 1 is a miss, and damages the weapon of the attacker. 

## Damage

• Light weapons (daggers) deal 1d6 + Strength bonus damage.
• Medium weapons (swords) deal 1d8 + Strength bonus
    damage if wielded in one hand or 1d10 + Strength bonus
    damage if wielded in both hands.
• Heavy weapons (hammers) deal 1d12 + Strength bonus
    damage but must be wielded in both hands.
• Thrown light weapons deal 1d6 damage.
• Bows and Slings deal 1d6 damage.
• Crossbows deal 1d12 damage.

## [Hit points](stats.md#hit-points)

"Don't Get hit points"
If you are at 0 you're fine.
Negatives? Then we have a problem.
See the [death and dismemberment table](DeathDismemberment.md)

## Weapon Proficiency

All classes are proficient with daggers. A PC is also proficient
with any weapons they gain from a class or background. A PC
has -4 to Attack with a weapon until they gain proficiency by
landing 8 successful hits in combat.

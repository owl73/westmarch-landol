# Advancement 

## Class Goals

**If you complete a class goal, you level up. Immediately.
Regardless of your experience points.**

## Experience

*1gp = 1xp*

Characters advance by gaining loot. 
For every 1gp equivalent of loot they bring back to town, a character earns
1xp.

You level up 1 time per return to town. 

*example*: you return with 400 gold, so you level up from level 1 to level 2.
The next time you adventure, you will achieve level 3 on return to town
regardless of treasure secured. 

## Leveling up

Level | XP | HP (24 Max) | Class Templates | Attack
1 | - | Con - 4 | 1 | 11
2 | 200 | Con - 2 | 2 | 12
3 | 400 | Con | 3 | 1 | 12
4 | 700 | Con + 2 | 4 | 13
5 | 1,000 | Con + 4 | - | 13
6 | 1,400 | Con + 6 | - | 14
7 | 1,800 | Con + 7 | - | 14
8 | 2,200 | Con + 8 | - | 15
9 | 2,600 | Con + 9 | - | 15
10 | 3,000 | Con + 10 | - | 15
+1 | +500 | +1 | - | 15

Whenever a PC levels, increase their HP, Attack, and base Save
(before their Charisma bonus is added). 

#### Increase stats

A PC can also test to improve 3 stats. 

- One the player chooses
- One the party chooses
- One the DM chooses

Roll 4d6, if the result is over, the statâ€™s value increases by 1.

### High level perks

###### Level 5

At Level 5, and every time a PC levels up past Level 5, they can
retire to safety. The GM cannot torment them anymore. If they
can afford it, they can buy some land, set up a shop, teach at a
wizard college, or beg in the gutter. 

When a character retires, their class becomes part of the choosable class list
if it wasn't a part of it already.

###### Level 10

At Level 10 and beyond, a
PC who dies can fight death. If they succeed, they can return to
life. All future Saves to avoid death will be at a penalty, but they
gain a second chance.

# Hirelings 

### Standard Hirelings

Hired at a fixed rate (see the price list). Dangerous work may
require bonuses. Generic hirelings have 10 in all stats, 5 HP, 5 Morale and
no skills outside their profession.

PCs can have up to 2+their Charisma bonus hirelings without
any issues. Extra hirelings can be acquired, but
may be disloyal, cunning, or poor quality.

Above any items required for their job, a hireling can carry 3
Inventory Slots worth of items for the PC.

There are different kinds of [standard
hirelings](../store#hirelings-and-folowers) 
you could hire for your journey. 
These are faceless, usually nameless, hirelings. They won't normally join in
combat or other activities outside of their profession without convincing. 

### Adventurer Hirelings

You can hire an adventurer as a Hireling for your journey. 
These hirelings will have better stats and will join in during adventuring.
However, they demand a cut of the treasure as well as a minimum flat rate 
(usually a few gold) when they go on an adventure with you.
Think of them as other player characters. 

To hire one, you must seek them out and you might come across a few or just
one. They will be individuals and could possibly be hired again later,
depending on how the adventure goes and how they are treated. 

The more experienced the hireling, 
and the more they are expected to contribute 
the more demanding they are of treasure. 

The player who hired the Hireling is required to roll for them and track
certain resources. 

Other than what was mentioned here, they operate the same as standard
hirelings.

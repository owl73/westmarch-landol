# Item Depletion

Each item has a chance to deplete when you use it. Maybe it gets damaged or
you're just running low. An item can deplete 3 times before it is broken/used. 
During each use, roll the item's depletion die (sometimes the roll is the use).
If you roll maximum, put an **X** next to the item to mark its use. 3 **X**s mean the
item is gone or broken or used up. 

### Depletion dice 
*weapons* = d20 your attack roll (a fumble is also damaging to your weapon)
*armor* = d20 a crit against you
*rations* = d1 (they just get used...)
*arrows* = d8 roll alongside attack (average of 24 arrows, might be able to
recover some though)
*torches*= d4 (rolled by me during dungeon exploration every 30 min, 3 torches per slot)

Armor gets a -1 to defense after 1 **X**. 

Weapons get a -1 to damage for every **X**, broken weapons are unusable (or might
count as a smaller weapon).

#### Examples:

You fire an arrow tearing off a goblins ear, and killing it (he wouldn't be
caught dead without it). But you rolled a 1 on the d8 when you attacked. You
now have depleted some arrows. You decide to save some for the ogre later, and
pull out your spear to face the rest of 'em. 

You're low on HP, but you're only ration is at X. You save some for lunch just
before the ogre, and one for the trip home. (rations heal)

After the ogre decided to sunder your father's spear it now seems pretty beaten
up (XX). You attack with it, rolling a 1 and tripping over it. It snaps in half
(XXX). Looks like its gonna need repaired. You pull out your butter knife to
finish him off.

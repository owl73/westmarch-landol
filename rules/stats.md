# Stats

## Rolling stats

### Basic check

Roll a d20 equal or under the value of your relevant stat. 

Example: You roll a 16, your strength is 16. You moved the bolder. 

Example: You roll a 13, your movement is 12. You trip and lose the chase.

### Contest Check

Each party rolls a d20 equal or under the relevant stat. (like a basic check)

- If both fail, no one makes progress. 
- If one succeeds, the other wins the contest
- If both succeed, the higher roll wins the contents 

### Special Check

These are rare. But in the case that there is something very difficult that not
just anyone smart or strong could do. You might be asked to roll one of these. 
However, you can play without worrying 

Roll a basic check as normal but not *too low*. 
If you roll under your stat you *might* succeed.
The DM will tell you how low is a failure. 

Example. 
*Benching a dragon is tough, roll a strength check **above 6**.*
Your strength is 14, you roll a 4. 
This would normally be a success, but you rolled below 6 so for this challenge
this would be a failure. If you rolled a 7-14 you would have succeeded. 


## 6 Core Attributes

- Strength
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma

Any time there is a test against one of these stats, roll a d20 and if the
result is equal or less than your atribute you succeed.

Generate these stats by rolling 3d6 for each one in order.

Each attribute has a bonus associated with it that will modify things like
damage, movement, or reaction rolls.
Refer to this table for bonuses.

Stat | Bonus
1, 2 | -3
3, 4, 5 | -2
6, 7, 8 | -1
9, 10 , 11 | 0
12, 13, 14 | +1
15, 16, 17 | +2
18, 19, 20 | +3
21, 22, 23 | +4
24 | +5

**CON - 4**

You start with your hp being equal to 4 less than your constitution.
You gain 2 per [level](level.md) with a maximum hp of 24.

#### Healing

1. Lunch heals a character for 1d6 HP. Lunch takes 1 hour, requires a safe place, and consumes 1 ration.

the next Lunch or Good Night’s Rest heals them to 0 and not
over 0.

Roll under this number for defense

### Movement

**10 + Dex bns. +  Armor penalty.**

This describes how fast your character can move. 

You might roll under this for chasing or running away.

### Stealth

**5 + Dex bns. +  Armor penalty.**

Add this to your roll verses an opponent's wisdom to sneak past.

### Save

**5 + Cha bns. + level**

If an effect, attack,

roll a d20 + save. 
Less than 20 is a failure. 
This represents a character’s luck and determination
to resist the cruel hand of fate.

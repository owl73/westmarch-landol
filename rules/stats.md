# Stats

## 6 Core Atributes

- Strength
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma

Any time there is a test against one of these stats, roll a d20 and if the
result is equal or less than your atribute you succeed.

Generate these stats by rolling 3d6 for each one in order.

Each attribute has a bonus associated with it that will modify things like
damage, movement, or reaction rolls.
Refer to this table for bonuses.

Stat | Bonus
1, 2 | -3
3, 4, 5 | -2
6, 7, 8 | -1
9, 10 , 11 | 0
12, 13, 14 | +1
15, 16, 17 | +2
18, 19, 20 | +3
21, 22, 23 | +4
24 | +5

## Other Stats

### Hit Points

**CON - 4**

You start with your hp being equal to 4 less than your constitution.
You gain 2 per [level](level.md) with a maximum hp of 24.

#### Healing

1. Lunch heals a character for 1d6 HP. Lunch takes 1 hour, requires a safe place, and consumes 1 ration.
2. A Good Night’s Rest. Restores all HP. Requires 8 hours of rest, a safe place, a fire or heat source, and consumes 1 ration.
3. Magical Healing. Some spells or potions restore HP. Others can heal Injuries.

Better food will heal you more.

If a character has negative HP (i.e. has taken [Lethal
Damage](DeathDismemberment.md)),
the next Lunch or Good Night’s Rest heals them to 0 and not
over 0.

### Attack Bonus

Starts at **0** and will increase as you [level](level.md). 

Add your attack roll to a d20 to attack something.

*[Weapon Proficiency](combat#weapon-proficiency)*

### Defense

- **10 + Dex bns**

OR

- **10 + Armor bns**

Armor | Bonus | penalty
Leather | +2 | 0
Chain | +4 | -2
Plate | +6 | -4
Shield | +1 | 0

This is the number an attack would need to roll to hit you.

### Movement

**10 + Dex bns. +  Armor penalty.**

This describes how fast your character can move. 

You might roll under this for chasing or running away.

### Stealth

**5 + Dex bns. +  Armor penalty.**

Add this to your roll verses an opponent's wisdom to sneak past.

### Save

**5 + Cha bns. + level**

If an effect, attack,
or challenge doesn’t fall under any of the other stats or values,
roll a d20 + save. 
Less than 20 is a failure. 
This represents a character’s luck and determination
to resist the cruel hand of fate.

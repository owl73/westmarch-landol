# Inventory and Items

PCs have a number of Inventory Slots equal to their Strength.
Only items carried count towards this limit. Horses, hirelings, and
carts do not count. Clothing, minor non-magical jewellery, and
other cosmetic items do not take up inventory slots unless they
are particularly bulky.

An Inventory Slot can contain:
- 3 Light Weapons (daggers)
- 1 Medium Weapon (sword)
- 0.5 Heavy Weapons (hammers)
- 1 Bow
- 20 Arrows
- 3 Bottles or Flasks
- 1 Lantern
- 3 Books
- 3 Rations
- 60 coins

The first 3 Inventory Slots are Quick-Draw Slots, and can be
accessed at any time. It takes 1 round to retrieve an item from
any other Inventory Slot.

Inventory management is crucial. Selecting and tracking
problem-solving tools is a player skill.

### Encumberance

Any items in excess of a character’s Inventory Slots (Strength)
gain 1 point of Encumbrance per slot. Each point of
Encumbrance imposes a -1 penalty to Stealth, Movement, and
Defense.

With 6 or more points of Encumbrance, moving quickly is
impossible. With 10 or more points of Encumbrance, moving
beyond a crawl is exhausting.

### Fatigue

Sprinting repeatedly, outdoor travel without rest, or excessively
tiring activities inflict Fatigue. Each level of Fatigue takes up 1
Inventory Slot. It is usually removed by resting.

## Armour
- **Leather armour** takes up 0 Inventory Slots 
- **Chain armour** takes up 2 Inventory Slots 
- **Plate armour** takes up 4 Inventory Slots 
- **Shields** take up 1 Inventory Slot and must be held to take effect

## Weapons

### Melee

- **Light weapons** take up 1/3rd of an Inventory Slot and deal 1d6 + Strength bonus damage in melee.
- **Medium weapons** take up 1 Inventory Slot and deal 1d8 + Strength bonus damage if wielded in one hand or 1d10 + Strength bonus damage if wielded in both hands.
- **Heavy weapons** deal 1d12 + Strength bonus damage but must be wielded in both hands.

### Ranged
Ranged weapons get -1 to Attack for every 10’ beyond their
listed range.

- Thrown light weapons (daggers) take up 1/3rd of an Inventory Slot and deal 1d6 damage and have a 20’ range.
- Slings take up 1 inventory slot. They deal 1d6 damage and have a 20’ range.
- Bows take up 1 inventory slot. They deal 1d6 damage and have a 30’ range.
- Crossbows take up 1 inventory slot. They deal 1d12 damage and have a 30’ range. A crossbow takes 1 round to reload.

Both bows and crossbows use arrows. One Inventory Slot can
contain 20 arrows. After combat, arrows can be recovered. 50%
will be usable.

Bows and crossbows deplete using a d8 for every shot made. 
Slings use a d4.

## Light Sources

Outside of the listed light range, light sources illuminate
shadows. Vague shapes, movement, and reflective surfaces will
be visible in shadows, but no details can be distinguished.

Light Source | Radius | Depletion
Torch | 20’ light, 20’ shadows | d4 (1 h)
Lantern | 30’ light, 30’ shadows | d6 / flask of oil (3 h)
Candle | 5’ light, 10’ shadows | d2 (1 h)

Lighting a torch or lantern takes 1 round. PCs are assumed to be
carrying basic firestarting gear. Magic or cantrips may ignite a
light source immediately.

The depletion die is rolled every 3 exploration turns (30 min).

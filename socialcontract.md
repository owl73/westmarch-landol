# Table Rules

### Be compfortable

Anyone can veto something going on in the game at any point if they find it
uncompfortable. 

If something bothers you, if someone gets out of hand, *say so!*
If you want to be discrete pass me a note, message me, text me, whatever you
want. 
Feel free to talk to me afterward if you want.

### Have fun

We are playing to have fun!
If you aren't having fun, let me know and we can work it out.

Want to play a certain kind of character?
*Tell me!*
I can work with you to make it happen. 

Are there some mechanics you don't like?
*Tell me!*
We can work to maybe change them. 
(we don't need hasbro to tell us how to play!)

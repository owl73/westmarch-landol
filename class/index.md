# Classes

Feel free to pick from the classes below. 

1. [Fighter](fighter.md)
2. Knight
3. Thief 
4. Wizard (Orthodox)
5. Wizard (Illusionist)

To randomly choose a class roll a d8 and tell me the result. 
I will let you know the result. It might not be on this list.

When you roll randomly, you cannot re-roll, you must either take the result of
the roll as your class or defer back to the list. If you were hoping for a
wizard and missed, you can still play a wizard but it must be from the list
above.

The if you play an unlisted class and retire that character, 
the list above may grow.

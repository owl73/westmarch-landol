# Classes

Feel free to pick from the classes below. 

1. [Fighter](fighter.md)
2. [Thief](thief.md)
3. [Wizard](wizard/) ([Orthodox](wizard/orthodox.md))
4. [Wizard](wizard/) ([Illusionist](wizard/illusionist.md))

* Random: d8 (Tell me the result)


## How classes work

Each class has 4 Templates. Templates are gained sequentially
(A, then B, then C, then D). To multiclass, simply pick the lowest
template from another class. E.g. A level 4 character could pick
Fighter A, Wizard A, Monk A, and Fighter B.
Multiclassing should make sense. Multiclassing for optimization
or mechanical reasons is discouraged but still allowed. 

A character starts with 1 template and gains one every level to a maximum of 4
templates. (You can continue leveling beyond 4 though).

#### Rolling

To randomly choose a class roll a d8 and tell me the result. 
I will let you know the result. It might not be on this list.

When you roll randomly, you cannot re-roll, you must either take the result of
the roll as your class or defer back to the list. If you were hoping for a
wizard and missed, you can still play a wizard but it must be from the list
above.

The if you play an unlisted class and retire that character, 
the list above may grow.

# Summoner

**Starting Equipment:** 2 sets of robes, dagger.

**Starting Skill:** Roll on adjacent table.

- **A:** +1 SD, +2 Entities, Summoning
- **B:** +1 SD, +1 Entity, Powerful Hold
- **C:** +1 SD, +1 Entity, Soul Vision
- **D:** +1 SD, +1 Entity (Chosen), Banish

#### A: Summoning

There are 99, and only 99, Entities that can be summoned. Each
has a name, a description, and a list of abilities.

To summon an Entity, select a number of Summoning Dice (SD)
you wish to invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. As a
Summoner, you get +1 SD per Summoner template. Some
effects depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum]
they show. Doubles generate Mishaps; triples generate Dooms.

Dice that roll 1-3 return to your summoning pool and can be
used again that day. Dice that roll 4-6 are removed from your
casting pool for the day. Entities are summoned for [sum] hours.
You can banish an Entity you have summoned at will, and
summon the same Entity multiple times per day (provided you
have SD left).

By default, Summons have 10 in all stats, 10 HP, are intelligent,
can speak and hear, and will obey the Summoner’s commands.

When you gain Template A, roll 2 d100s and gain the Entities
listed. Template B and C, roll 1d100. Template D, choose one
Entity or roll 1d100. If a duplicate Entity is rolled, reroll.
You can try to end reality-warping or summon-type effects by
pouring any number of SD into a target and hoping for the best.
Effects are adjudicated by the GM, but are usually haphazard
and dangerous. Mishaps and Dooms apply.

You can detect the presence of summoned creatures or
unnatural effects if you are not distracted. To learn details about
the effect, roll under Intelligence.

#### B: Powerful Hold
Choose one Entity you know how to summon. The Entity is
summoned for [sum]x2 hours instead of [sum] hours. Whenever
you gain a level, you can change which Entity this effect targets.
#### C: Soul Vision
You can see the souls of living creatures. This allows you to
guess the approximate location of invisible creatures. You can
also immediately tell if a person is possessed, undead, protected
by the Authority, or a spellcaster. The price for this gift is your
connection to others. You permanently lose 1d6 Wisdom (as the
constant scrutiny of souls warps your mind) or 1d6 Charisma (as
you become callous and jaded).
#### D: Banish
Point at an unnatural or summoned creature within 100’ and
invest any number of SD. If [sum] is equal to or greater than the
creature’s HD, it is banished to wherever it came from.
Creatures with 3 or more HD can Save to negate.

### Mishaps

1 | SD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24hrs.
2 | Take 1d6 damage.
3 | Mute and Blind for 1d6 rounds.
4 | Agony for 1d6 rounds.
5 | Summon has a 1-in-6 chance of vanishing each hour after being summoned. Roll at the start of each hour.
6 | Summon is not under your control. It will pursue its own agenda for the duration of the summon

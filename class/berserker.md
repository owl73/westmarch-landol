### A:	Berserk
Berserkers fight in a trancelike state, seeming to revert into furious animals.
You may enter Berserk  at the beginning of combat or as soon as you see
bloodshed. You act first in combat and deal 1 + 1 additional damage per
template of Berserker. You cannot speak while in Berserk and cannot exit
berserk until the violence has ended. You don't fully remember what happened
when you regain consciousness.

### A:	Wild Born
Natural weather doesn't effect you. 
You can eat most plants and animals without worry. 
You feel more at home in nature. 

### B: Trial of the Fiends
The Berserker gains the aspect of the animal they killed in the Trial of the
Fiends. You gain the aspect of the animal you killed, may communicate with and
easily locate that animal type, and gain its pelt along with the following
benefits of that animal...
- Bear: Increase your Constitution and Strength by 1, You may make a bite attack dealing 1d4 damage.
- Wolf: Increase your Strength and Intelligence by 1, You gain a perfect natural scent ability.
- Boar: Increase your Strength and Dexterity by 1, You may charge in combat gaining +1 to your attack and dealing 1d6 extra damage.
- Panther: Increase your Dexterity by 2, you gain +1 on all stealth checks and deal an additional 1d8 damage on surprise attacks.

### C: Woodland Sense
You have a sense for the emotions of the natural world, it breathes through
you. You can spend an hour accommodating to the natural world around you to
gain the answer to one of the following questions or a question of your own...
	- What happened here?
	- Is something out of balance?
	- Where are other Wildmen?
	- Is danger near?
	- What is the attitude of the wildlife?

### C: Carnivorous Feast
Consumption of raw flesh is not unusual for the Berserker, they are after all,
more beast than man. After combat has ended you may consume the flesh of fallen
foes. This counts as a lunch break for you and heals 1d8 HP instead of 1d6. You
may do this after each battle but may not benefit from normal lunchbreaks. 

### D: Apex Predator
You embody the aspect of the apex predator, a beast of gore and violence. You
may make two attacks each turn. Whenever you kill in combat, you immediately
may take another turn.

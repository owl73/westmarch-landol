### A: Just Business

You have no time for messing around with personal issues. You're working. 
You attack twice each round against your current target.

### A: Gathering Info

After an hour in a small town, or a day in a city of asking around, you know if
your target:
- is still here
- has been here
- has never been here

Each time you gather info roll a wisdom check. 
On a success you either:
- Find them 
- Learn where they left for
- or Learn where they might be

### B: Fighting Dirty

Once per combat, instead of attacking you can choose to stun, blind or
deafen an enemy for a round. 

### C: Come Quietly

When armed, you can choose to intimidate a target with less HD than you. 
If the target fails a moral check. They give in without a fight. 

However, expect an escape attempt.

### D: Dead or Alive

Pick how you want your target. Each gives a different bonus. 
- Alive 
- Dead 

###### Alive
You don't have to worry about accidentally killing your target. Whenever you or
someone fighting alongside you would kill your target, instead, you can decide
that they survive and are knocked unconscious. This applies to any damage, even
ones that seem un-survivable. 

###### Dead

Your first hit against your target does additional maximum damage. 
This can be done once a day.

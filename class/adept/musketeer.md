### A: Musket
You are in possession of a musket, not yet common throughout the world. When
firing your musket you gain +1 to Attack and Damage per Musketeer template.
If you roll a 19 or 20 to attack with your musket, roll on the misfire
table. If your gun breaks or jams you must spend 1 hour to repair it.

A musket deals 3d6 damage. 
It takes 5-[Template] turns to reload your musket. 

Misfire Table
1.  Jam: Musket jams and is useless for the rest of the combat
2. Blowback: Musket backfires dealing 1d4 damage to you and breaks
3. Smoke and Steam: you are engulfed in a cloud of small and steam and are
stunned for one round
4. Failed Ignition: nothing happens, musket does not fire this turn
5. Shattered Musket Ball: the musket ball breaks inside the barrel spraying
shrapnel in a cone in front of you. Every character downrange of the
musket takes 1d2 piercing damage and your musket breaks
6. Dud Powder: powder fails to ignite, nothing happens and you must clear
and reload your musket 

### A: Opening Salvo

A crack of a musket is often followed by a valiant charge into combat.
After you hit with a musket, you gain +1 to Attack and Damage with
melee weapons until the end of your next turn.

### B: Panache 

Musketeers exude a flamboyant panache. People generally enjoy the
company of a Musketeer and are friendlier toward you sometimes paying
for your drinks in exchange for good stories. You put a dash of
panache into everything, you can choose to re roll any check once each
day, putting some extra oomph and show into it strictly for
entertainment value.

### B: Duelist’s Repost

Musketeers may parry melee attack and immediately repost. Once each round if
you defend against a melee attack you may repost, making a free attack but
using your defense stat as your Attack stat.


### C: Musketeer’s Vogue 

Musketeers are the birds of paradise to noble armies and mercenary
companies. You are decorated beyond what’s reasonable, and are the
cutting edge of modern fashion. You gain a Fancy Gambian, Decorated
Feathered Morion, and brightly colored tights. This new wave of
fashion is often surprising to most and sparks conversations favorable
when speaking with wealthy individuals. In combat your attire can be
surprisingly distracting, roll a contested Charisma check, if you
succeed you distract an opponent who can see you, giving them
disadvantage on their next attack. A character can only be distracted
once each day. 

### D: Deadshot

Muskets are extremely deadly weapons. You also crit on natural 1s.
When you get a critical hit with your musket there is an additional
devastating effect, roll on the table below.

1. Center Mass: stuns target for 1 round
2. Blinding: target is blinded
3. Extra powder: packed a-little extra heat in the chamber, +1d6 extra
damage
4. Dismemberment: target loses a random limb
5. Knock Back: target is knocked prone and provokes an attack from
anyone in melee with that character
6. Head Shot: target is killed

# Dark Informant

Questions are best left unanswered, you ask the questions. You are the hand of
a dark, nefarious power, acting in their behalf. You work in shadows to gain
intelligence, quietly working against those who think of you as friends. Be
weary, this path is one of deception and darkness, no good may come of it...

**Starting Equipment:** Leather Armor, Hooded Cloak, Short Sword, Spy's Kit

**Starting Skill:** Deception, Stealth

+ **A:** Two Faces, Alternate Class A
+ **B:** Dark Turn, Alternate Class B
+ **C:** Puppet Master, Alternate Class C
+ **D:** Snake in the Grass

**Level Goal:**

one of your Nefarious Secrets

+ **D:** Personally kill or attempt to kill a close friend

**Bonus:** At the beginning of each session during the Rumor Phase, you may
give the GM a ***Nefarious Secret***, that works against the party, making the
session harder. At the end of the session you gain 50 additional gold per Dark
Informant Template.

**Drawback:** If anyone in your party discovers you are a Dark Informant you
must leave the party and make a new character; however, after you leave the
party, all other players in your party may immediately attempt to reroll one of
their stats.

### A:	Two Faced
You have two faces and are not what you appear to be. You mimic on the
appearance of another archetype to mask your true intentions. Select another
Class as your second face. You gain one of that classes Templates each level
and are effectively that class, except that you must complete the Level Goals
of the Dark Informant to progress.

### B: Dark Turn
You keep a Dark Turn hidden, waiting to reveal its true purpose. Once each
session, at any point, you may secretly share a Dark Turn with the GM which
they try to immediately incorporate into the session or encounter. This secret
must make things more difficult for the party but must fit with the current
circumstances.

### C: Puppet Master
You help to pull the strings from behind the scenes. Once each combat you may
secretly specify how a single enemy character attacks, informing the GM before
the combat starts or mid combat to change that character's strategy. 

### D: Snake in the Grass
After a snake bis beheaded flowers often grow from its remains. Good tends to
emerge when darkness subsides. You must Retire your character and create a new
one. Any players who's characters you killed gain three stat rerolls and may
either choose to permanently gain +3 HP or increase their attack stat by 1 for
their new characters. If a player killed you, they gain permanently gain either
+1 to Attack or Defense.

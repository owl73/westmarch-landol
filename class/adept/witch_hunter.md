### A:	Witch Hunt

When seeking witches or other dark magicians, you have the support of most

slaying of a witch. You are paid 1d10 x 5 gold per witch or dark magicianâ€™s
head you bring to any ruler of a settlement.

You have or can find knowledge of any current witch hunts. 

### A: Superstitious Symbol

Your charm bering your superstious symbol, grants you a resistance to magic 
with a bonus of +1 per template to saves verses magic.

The charm is cool, and only warms when an active spell is near.
The warmer the charm the more powerful the spell.

### B: Guild Membership

You gain access to the prestigious guild of Witch Hunters. You have access to
guild resources, lodging, and knowledge in all major towns. There is a 1/3
chance that any town will have at least one Witch Hunter whom you can find and
talk with. You may hire Witch Hunters at a rate of 15 gold per week.

### B: Tools of the Trade
Being funded by nobles has its benefits, granting you the best weapons money
can buy. You can choose two qualities for each your crossbow and longsword.

lined weapons deal an addition 1d6 damage to magic users and 1d8 damage to

day.

### D: Adorned Symbol

Your Superstitous symbol becomes a powerful antimagic item. 

When hit with a spell, you can choose to rebuke it by presenting your symbol. 
The rebuke causes the spell to rebound and the [sum] of the magic dice involved
harm the caster. The spell is nullified and your symbol breaks in the process. 

A new symbol will be provided when you make contact with your guild.

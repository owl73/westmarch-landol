### A: Research 

On a successful inteligence check, the DM provides a piece of information about 
a monster of the player's choice. 
This can be atempted only once for each kind of monster, 
afterward more INT checks can be made after a
day or week of study. The time depends on the rarity of the monster, and the
source of information. (direct observation is best, town rumor and legends are
worst)

Example common questions to ask the DM:
- what is a weakness
- what is a special ability
- what is a tactic it uses 
- how intelegent is it
- what is its favorite food 

### A: Personal Interest

After seeing a beast, give it a name, and you mark it. You get +[Template]
damage against it.

### B: Tracking

After seeing a monster, you can track that specific monster without a check so
long as it is trackable (hasn't flown away or teleported or otherwise hasn't
left some trail) 

### B: Trophies 

Once you have killed a monster of personal interest, you can take part of 
its corpse as a trophy. This trophy, will be worth 30 gold per hit die of the
killed monster. 

You can choose to keep and wear the trophy as good luck instead. This will
provide you +1 defense and +1 attack against a monster of the same species. 

You can wear 5 trophies at a time. 

A trophy can be a tattoo referencing your kill if you wish. This
counts as permanently wearing the trophy but not toward your total trophies
worn. 


### C: Trapping expert

With some materials you can set up a trap for a beast you have a personal
interest in. You must invest 10gold in the trap for materials and set it up
over the course of 1 to 8 hours depending on its size. 

The trap deals [template]d6 damage. Add a d6 of damage for each extra 10 gold
you invest in the trap.

So long as your monster of interest is hungry and can access your trap,
your trap will be set off by your target if you bait it with its favorite food. 


### D: Vitals

When you hit a monster you have named, once per week you can choose to wound
them. Give them a condition on the from the death and dismemberment table.

**Starting Skill:** Surgery, Medicine, Anatomy

**Bonus:** All characters heal an additional 1 HP per Physician template during

### A: Medical Manuscript
Youâ€™ve seen many wounds in your day and have picked up a knowledge of how to
heal them. Any time you encounter a lasting wound or injury, roll an
intelligence check, if you are successful you may record that wound and how to
best treat in your Manuscript. Whenever you encounter that injury again you may
reduce the healing time by half for patients you treat.

### A: First Aid
You can administer medicine instead of acting in combat to either stop
bleeding, remove a status effect, or stabilize a dying comrade without making a
check.

### B: Injections
You carry an array of injections in your medical bag, each with potent effects.
You carry one Injection for each template of Physician. Injections can be
swapped at a hospital or at another Physician's residence. 

You may use a number of Injections equal to 1 + [Template] each day.

**Opioids**:
You can apply a sedative to remove negative conditions of wounds for one day.

**Stimulants**:
Invigorates the patient, they get +1 to Attack, Dexterity, and defense for the
next combat.

**Anti-poison**:
You can inject Anti-position to cure poison and venoms.

**Antibiotics**:
Administered antibiotics cure no magical diseases and infections. 

**Adrenaline**:
Inject adrenaline before a combat to grant 1d4 temporary HP for the next
combat.

**Stem-cells**:
These regenerative serums can quickly heal minor injuries. Heal 1d2 HP
instantly 

### C: Amputation 
You can use your bone saw to remove a limb, saving the life of someone. If a
comrade would die in combat you may perform am amputation within 3 rounds of
their death. You amputate the most reasonable limb based on their injuries,
then roll a die; if the result is even the surgery is a success and they are
not killed, but unconscious instead, gaining the Missing Limb injury. On an odd
result the surgery is either a failure or they were already beyond saving.

### C: Medical Knowledge
You have a mental codex of medical information from your studies. 
You are able to identify the severity of any
wounds, how close someone is to death, the effects of positions or venom, and
diagnose and treat diseases.

### D: Therapeutic Serums 
You have devised a medicine which can be applied to a large array of wounds.
You must spend an hour each day for a week to create one Therapeutic Serum. You
may have one Serum in your possession at a time. 

The serum places the character into a 10 min coma, after which they are healed 
to full HP and all non-permanat injuries are healed.

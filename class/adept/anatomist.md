# Anatomist

The body is not a temple. It is a machine. One that can be repaired, changed,
and improved. You are not a medic, you are a mechanic of the flesh.

**Starting Equipment:** Anatomy book, dagger, surgical tools, Bloody robes.

**Starting Skill:** medicine, biology

+ **A:** Surgical Experiments, Flesh market, Harvest 
+ **B:** Major operation, Weird Repair
+ **C:** Monstrous Mutation, Vitals
+ **D:** Aberrant Alteration

**Level Goals**: 

+ **A:** 
Get expelled from a medical program for malpractice. 
+ **B:** 
Perform surgery on a living human, and successfully add a part that doesn't
belong.
+ **C:** 
Replace a patient's organ with one of a monster successfully.
+ **D:** 
Recreate a working monstrous organ or component using human parts. Keep it as a
reference. If you lose it, make another.

**Drawback:**
-[Template] CHA against people who know you are an anatomist.   

### A: Surgical Experiments

You experiment on a helpless or willing creature or yourself over the course of 
3 hours. 

You randomly mutate a creature, or pick a mutation you have recorded. 
When you experiment on a creature, you randomly mutate them or repeat the
effects of an experiment you have previously recorded.
You can record the process of 2x[Template] experiments. 

Surgical Experimentation is dangerous.
Roll a d20 for a surgery check.
The you must roll under or meet a target number to succeed.
A failure results in a random side effect. 
A roll of 20 results in the patient dying.
You can modify this target in the following ways:

    Target 5 + [Template]
    +3 sterile environment
    +3 for living donor 
    +1 for expending spare biological components

- sight 
- reflexes
- food consumption
- strength
- focus
- memory
- awareness
- hearing
- smell
- weather resistance
- more HP
- agility
- attractive
- Alcohol resistance
- Youth / old
- disease 
- fatigue
- sleep
- pheromones
- touch

- - limb
- - Hole

### A: Harvest Specimen 
You extract an organ or other biological component from a corpse. 
You can extract 1d4 organs or components from a living specimen.

Each organ or lump of flesh takes 1 inventory slot.

### A: Flesh Market

You can buy or sell flesh on the black market. 

- Organs d20 gold
- Components d20 gold
- Damaged human cadaver 2d10
- Undamaged human cadaver 2d10+20

This activity is illegal.

### B: Vitals

Careful study of humanoid anatomy allows you to target vitals. 
You can use your attack to blind, deafen, stun, sicken or cause a target to 
bleed. 

You can do this once per day.

### B: Major Operation

Your surgical experiments can now involve major anatomical additions and
rearrangements.

This process requires additional organs, biological material, or ideally an
extra body. 

This is more deadly. 
when doing a major operation, the patient dies on a surgical experiment check
of 19 or more. 

### C: Monstrous Mutation

You can now transplant components of monsters to humans as surgical
experiments.

This gives the patient a special ability of the donor monster and requires some 
relevant monstrous component available for use in the experiment.

Instead of a side effect on a failed check
the patient is guaranteed a side effect, and a failed check results in the
patient rejecting the monstrous mutation in 1d10 days.

When doing a Monstrous Mutation, the patient dies on 
a surgical experiment check of 18 or more.

### C: Weird Repair

Use of spare organs or flesh can quickly repair a wound. 
The process will negate the detriment of one wound but cause a side effect. 
Removing a fatal wound stabilizes the patient and causes 3 side effects.

### D: Aberrant Alteration

You can now use human flesh in place of monstrous components in your recorded
monstrous mutations. 

You need multiple donors for this process equal to the HD of the monstrous
donor.

There is no chance of rejection. 
Now a failed check results in another side effect. 

The patient now dies on a check of 17 or more.

#### Sterile Tools

You can re-roll 1 surgical experiment check per day.

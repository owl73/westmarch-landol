The hand, mouth, and eyes of that which has no place tinkering in this world,
nor in this dimension.

**Starting Equipment:** Ornate Hooded Cloak, Weird Eldritch Idol, Incense,
Ornate Dagger

**Starting Skills:** Spellcraft, Hidden Lore, Astrology


+ **A:** Conjure Strange, Dark Offering
+ **B:** Esoteric Mysticism, Extract Thought
+ **C:** Dimension-Warp, Dagger of the Elder Ones
+ **D:** True Form


**Level Goal:**

+ **A:** Obtain an Eldritch relic or idol.
+ **B:** Offer a part of yourself, a willing person, and an unwilling person to
the desires of an Eldritch being.
+ **C:** Enter the plane of an Elder God and pledge your servitude to that
being, by either; 1) presenting it with an ornate dagger coated in your blood.
Plunge the fatter into your stomach, pass a Constitution save or Die. 2)
offering your mind to the being, you lose 1d4 intelligence, 1d4 charisma, and
1d4 wisdom ad the entity extracts your essence, mind, and experiences.
+ **D:** Before an Elder God, perform a ritual offering up of your mind and
body, as well as three unwilling others.


**Bonus:** You may take 1d6 Intelligence damage to regain an MD. If you are
reduced to 0 intelligence your essence is torn from this dimension and consumed
by the ancient slumbering ones. 


**Drawback:** Mages distrust you, they sense your power stems from a place
deeply unnatural. At D template mages know you are not of this plane.


### A:	Conjure Strange
Through the powers of the unthinkable, you lash the bodies of your foes,
conjuring forth what should not exist. Each turn you may use your attack to
conure a random effect on a target.
    + 1. Weird Wounds: 1d6 damage, wounds do not heal until the next day and
    cannot be healed naturally.
    + 2. Mind Crank: Target is stunned for one round and takes [Erdrich
    Visionary Template] Intelligence damage (if reduced to 0 intelligence that
    creature’s essence is torn from this dimension).
    + 3. Unnatural Limbs: An unnatural tentacle bursts from the targets body,
    dealing 1d4 damage and then attacking the target or anyone adjacent each
    turn for 1d2 +[Erdrich Visionary Template] turns before wilting and
    detaching.
    + 4. Blackness: a mist of thick black fog surrounds the target in a 20 foot
    radius lasting for 1d6  +[Erdrich Visionary Template] rounds. Anyone in the
    mist takes 1d2 acid damage each round and takes on intelligence damage each
    round that they start in the mist.
    + 5. Strange: an unimaginable entity emerges, no larger than a cat which
    attacks the target for 1d2 rounds before blinking out of existence
    (creature has Attack/Defense/Save 10; 6 HP, 1d6 +[Erdrich Visionary
    Template] damage).
    + 6. See Beyond: target receives visions of another dimension and must make
    an Intelligence save or be Shaken for 1d2 rounds
    + 7. Siphon Essence: target takes 1d4 damage and you or another comrade
    heal an equal amount.
    + 8. Bizarre: target temporarily mutates into a bizarre form, they gain
    disadvantage on Attack and Defense they lose control of their bodily
    movements for [Erdrich Visionary Template] rounds.
    + 9. Blip: target dematerializes for 1 round before emerging back into
    reality, they must make an Intelligence save or their mind is broken from
    the unthinkable things they witnessed in the in between of planes.
    + 10. The Unthinkable: something unthinkable happens, the GM decides the
    effects.

### A:	Dark Offering
Through ritual offerings consisting of ceremonial chanting, the burning of
incense, and the consumption of powerful hallucinogenic substances you are able
to reach a state of contact with Erdrich entities of other dimensions. You may
provide offerings to these entities in exchange for information, boons, the
casting of spells, or even the warping of your reality. The amount offered is
proportional to how powerful the response, information, boon, or other conjured
gifts are. The dark ones do favor offerings of blood, the sacrifice of
knowledge, and the gifts of magic spells.

### B: Esoteric Mysticism
Through the strange laminations of time and other dimensions, you pull forth a
strange form of mysticism. Your Weird Eldritch Idol functions as a Wizard’s
Spell Book. You cast spells as a wizard. You have a number of MD and spells
known equal to your [Erdrich Visionary Template]-2 (minimum 1) and select
spells from the Erdrich Visionary spell list. All creatures capable of complex
thought must must save agains your spells using their Intelligence save. 

### B: Extract Thought
Through esoteric rituals and contact with extra dimensional beings you are
capable of extracting other’s thoughts. A number of times per day equal to your
[Erdrich Visionary Template] you may reach out and touch a target: if they fail
an Intelligence save, you may ask the GM a question and gain an answer if that
character would know it, extracting the information from their brain. You gain
that knowledge and they forget it. The target then takes 1d6 Intelligence
damage.

### C: Dimension-Warp
You conjure forth a strange segment of another dimension which warps and merges
with that of reality. This area is 2d100 x [Eldrich Visionary Template] +100
square feet centered on a target within eyesight. It takes two rounds to
conjure the Dimension-Warp. Roll on each of the following tables once to
determine the properties of the Shifted dimension. The Dimension-Warp lasts a
number of hours equal to the result of the 1d10 rolled previously. You may
expend an MD to reroll any of the variables of Dimension-Warp.
	**Landscape**
    The general real world parallel, what the other dimension most closely
    resembles.
	+ 1. Plains
	+ 2. Jungle
	+ 3. Desert
	+ 4. Rocky 
	+ 5. Swamp
	+ 6. Cave
	+ 7. Mountainous
	+ 8. Void of notable natural features 
	+ 9. Liquid landscape such as lake or riverbed
	+ 10. Unthinkable, something truly out of this world
	
	**Hazard**
	Horrific environments always have hazards, some more deadly than others.
    + 1. Violent winds: characters must make a Dexterity or Strength save each
    round or be knocked prone
    + 2. Violent plants or entities of the landscape: each round the plane may
    make 1d10 attacks on the creatures in the plane (Attack 10, damage 1d6 B,
    P, or S)
    + 3. Extreme temperatures: pick hot or cold, all characters take 1 damage
    each round in the area.
    + 4. Harmful gasses, pick one: 1) Noxious all characters must make a
    Constitution save each round or be sickened 2) corrosive gasses all metal
    objects become corroded and break on critical fails, everyone takes 1 acid
    damage each round
    + 5. Violent creatures strange small beasts savagely attack everyone in the
    plane: 1d8 creatures lurk in the environment (HP 1d12, Defense/Attack 11,
    damage 1d8)
    + 6. Environmental: some hazard riddles the plane, this could be water,
    acid pools, floating rocks, sundered earth, or razor sharp grasses
	+ 7. Murky black fog obscures vision beyond 10 feet
    + 8. Lack of oxygen, can only source a number of rounds in the area equal
    to constitution

    + 1. Any buildings warp into enormous immobile beasts, writhing and
    wiggling… hopefully you don’t end up inside one.
    + 2. The aesthetics of the place are unthinkable, mind bending fear
    envelops all within the area, all characters must make a Wisdom save or be
    panicked.
    + 3. Bright strands of glistening silver float and wriggle through the air,
    strands of time. There is a 1/3 chance any character in the area stutters
    out of the time space continuum and loses their turn.
    + 4. The ground writhes as if alive, all characters must make dexterity
    checks to not be staggered. If a character fails two checks they fall
    prone. If they are prone they must save vs Strength or be strangled by
    tentacles that envelop them from the earth itself.
    + 5. The air cracks with arcane power. Anyone who can cast spells gains an
    extra MD while in the area.
    + 6. Incests buzz wildly, consuming all that exists. Each turn all
    creatures in the plane must make a Constitution save or take 1d4 damage as
    the insects bite and burrow into you flesh.
    + 7. Visions of your past and future flood your minds. Each character must
    make an Intelligence save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. If you succeed you
    may ask the GM a question about anything as unlimited knowledge floods
    though you.
    + 8. A large slug like creature sits in a library of squirming books made
    from pages of seemingly living creatures. It scours the pages of the books,
    using multiple tentacles and eyes to view countless books at once.

    their bodies mutated and corrupted. They attack everyone in the plane.
    + 10. Odd jellyfish like creatures float though the air, they seem to
    ignore you.
    + 11. A massive beholder with hundreds of eye stocks floats through the
    air, attacking anyone it sees with magic rays shot through its eyes.
    + 12. A large mirror towers above, nearly 20 feet tall. When you pier into
    it it acts as a scry spell. When you use the mirror you may look into the
    present, but take 1 Wisdom damage.
    + 13. A giant humanoid being looms above you. It’s body is covered in
    patchy fur. It’s limbs are odd and warped. Eyes are imbedded over the
    creatures entire body. It has no head and Carrie’s a large rusty great axe.
	+ 14. 1d20 child sized bat-like creatures fly over head attacking everyone. 
    + 15. A single mass of flesh and tentacles rests in a pool of black water,
    tentacles are spread throughout the dimension stemming from the writhing
    mass in the pool.
    + 16. You find 1d4 other adventures lost in time space in varying states of
    sanity.
    + 17. The vet yet of the plane cracks and warps as an enormous maw bites
    and eats through the air, tentacles burst from the ground around it
    swinging violently trying to grab anyone in the plane.

    of the plane. The lights inside it are on.

### C: Dagger of the Elder Ones
You possess a strange ritual dagger, any time you make an attack with the
dagger
It deals damage to both the body and to the mind of creatures capable of
complex thought (1d2 HP damage and 1d6 Intelligence damage). Whenever you
reduce a target to 0 Intelligence that being immediately dies: you heal 1d6
intelligence damage and may learn a piece of relevant information that being
possessed before their death by the Dagger of the Elder Ones.

### D: The True Form
Select one of the attributes from the Body category, one from the size
category, and 2 from the Weird category; whenever you shift into your true form
you gain those benefits. These may not be changed. Conceive an image of this
being, this is your true form, your human form is simply a mask.

You may choose to sacrifice any Template of Eldritch Visionary (except for
Esoteric Mysticism and Eldritch Omniscience) for an additional 2 Weird

Omniscience, and Esoteric Mysticism you lose the ability to shift into your
human form, but gain an additional 1d4 MD at the start of each day.

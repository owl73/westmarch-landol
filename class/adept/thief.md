# Thief

**Starting Equipment:** leather armour, lockpicks, dagger.

**Starting Skill:** Locksmith and Pickpocket. Also, roll on the
adjacent table. You may roll on the Table of Professions for a
cover story. Gain the item but not the skill listed.

**Level Goal**: Secure a Named Treasure

- **A:** Always Prepared, Evaluate, Wall Crawler
- **B:** Lucky, Quick Draw
- **C:** Backstab
- **D:** Great Escape, Very Lucky

You gain +1 to Stealth for each Thief template you possess.

### A: Always Prepared

In town, you may spend any amount of money to buy an
Unlabelled Package. When the package is unwrapped, you
declare what it contains, as long as the contents comprise the
appropriate number of Inventory Slots, don’t cost more than you
originally paid, and are available in town. You can put multiple
items inside a large Unlabelled Package, including smaller
Unlabelled Packages. You can have up to two Unlabelled
Packages at a time.

### A: Evaluate

You automatically know the worth of non-treasure items. 
You can roll to evaluate the worth of treasure [template]x2 times 
before returning to sell them.
Unique items may require you to roll under Intelligence to glean their worth.

### A: Wall Crawler

You can climb as well without climbing gear as most people can
with climbing gear. Simple climbs do not require a test. You can
attempt impossible climbs.

### B: Lucky

You may reroll 1 d20 roll per day.

### B: Quick Draw

Gain an additional 3 Quick Draw Slots.

### C: Backstab

Whenever you have a situational bonus to an Attack roll, attacks
that hit deal +1d6 damage.

### D: Great Escape

Once per day, you can automatically escape from something
that is restraining you and that you could plausibly escape from.
This includes grapples, lynchings, pit traps, and awkward social
situations, but not sealed coffins.

### D: Very Lucky

You may use your Lucky ability twice per day. An adjacent ally
can use one of your rerolls, provided you could have plausibly
assisted them.

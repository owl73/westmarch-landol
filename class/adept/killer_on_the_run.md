### A:	Killer's Instinct
The instincts of a killer are malign and sharp. Whenever you kill you know if
its is possible for that kill to be traced back to you or if you've done the
dark deed without leaving any trace. If you have left evidence you can attempt
to hide it with a successful Intelligence check.

### A: In Cold Blooded
Some killings are unprovoked, in cold blood alone... for the sake of sanguine
blood and the thrill of taking what can never be regained. At the beginning of
each session you can decide to have committed a murder in cold blood. If you
choose to have committed a murder you gain an additional attack for the
duration of the session, however there is a 1/2 chance that you become wanted
in the area where you are and have an active search for you by city guard or
concerned citizens. 

### B:	Cereal
You thrive off the thrill of the kill, gaining confidence for each life you
take. Each session you begin a new spree of cereal killings. Whenever you get a
kill you gain one of the following bonuses which stack until the end of the
game session. You may accumulate a number of bonuses each session equal to you
Killer on the Run Template +1.
	A. +1 Damage
	B. +1 Attack
	C. Increase critical range by 1

### B: Hideout
You are cunning and crafty, able to find a place to hid in most circumstances.
Whenever you enter a settlement you can look for a hideout where you can remain
hidden. Roll an Intelligence check, if you succeed you are able to fine a
Hideout in that settlement, if you fail you are unable to find a suitable
location. If you are in a large city you may roll twice to find a Hideout,
taking the better result.

### C: Slit-Throat
The blade of a murderer is definitive, deadly, persisse, used with dark intent.
You aim for weak points in human anatomy, such as the throat. When you get a
critical hit with a one handed bladed weapon, you deal triple damage as your
blade hits a vital spot or slits your enemies throat.

### C: Killer's Eyes
You are keen at perceiving other like minded individuals. You can tell when
someone has killed and if that killing was for a good, evil, or personal cause.
You know if someone is a criminal killer or if they are a mercenary killing for
gold, you can tell the difference in the depth of their eyes.

### D: King of Killers
You are known through the cities you enter as a true killer, a man to be
feared. You are regarded as the King of Killers in the black networks of
cities. You can call upon the help of up to 1d6 killers in each settlement you
enter. They are as loyal as killers could be, although if bound together by
blood, their loyalty and discretion is absolute. Your reputation seeps into the
city guard as well, if you would be confronted by two or fewer guards, you can
dissuade them from further pursuing you by leveraging your killer reputation
alone if you succeed an Intimidation check against them.

# Hunter

**Starting Equipment:** bow, 40 arrows, dagger, leather armour.

**Starting Skill:** Wilderness. Also, roll on adjacent table.

- **A:** Rangefinder, Wilderness Sense
- **B:** Crippling Shot, Precision
- **C:** True Caution
- **D:** Impossible Shot, Vanish

You gain +1 to Stealth for each Hunter template you possess.

#### A: Rangefinder
You get -1 to attack with ranged weapons for every 20’ past the
listed range, instead of every 10’.
#### A: Wilderness Sense
After the GM gives you the Omen for an encounter, you can
choose to reroll the encounter and get a different Omen. You
must accept the new result. You have a 50% chance to act in
surprise rounds.
#### B: Crippling Shot
If you hit an enemy with a ranged weapon, you can choose to
deal 1 damage instead of rolling for damage. The next attack
made by the enemy deals ½ normal damage.
#### B: Precision
When you gain this template, choose either Strength or
Dexterity. Add the chosen stat’s bonus to damage rolls made
with ranged weapons (bows, crossbows, thrown daggers, etc.)
#### C: True Caution
After the GM gives you the Omen for an encounter, you can
choose to reroll the encounter and get a different Omen. You can
choose between the two Omens (and Encounters). You can
always act in a surprise round.
#### D: Impossible Shot
Once per combat, you can make an impossible shot with a
ranged weapon. The attack automatically hits the target,
provided it is within 2x the weapon’s listed rage. The attack can
bounce around corners, cut a coin in half, or part a single hair on
a target’s head.
#### D: Vanish
If you are in dense forests, hills, caves, or other terrain with
abundant line-of-sight-blocking features, you can choose to
vanish. While vanished, you cannot affect the world or be
affected by it. This ability is limited by plausibility. You can
reappear at any time by climbing down a tree, walking over a hill,
emerging from a shrub, etc.

+1 save per 2 templates of Hedge Knight

### A: Glorified Mercenary
In essence you are a mercenary, a glorified one at that. Your history demands
higher compensation for your work. You gain 25% more coin any time you would
receive a monetary reward for mercenary work. 

### A: Lone Wolf
You are highly trained in martial combat and know how to hold your own against
the word. Whenever you are in one on one melee combat your attacks deal
additional damage equal to the number of Hedge Knight templates you have


### B: Bastard’s Blood
You’ve always been excluded, born a noble and expelled from your own house. You
now carry a hatred for nobility and a determined grit. You make two attacks
each turn against nobility, anyone working for a noble house, and other knights
or Hedge Knights.


### C: Iron Clad
You are tough as nails, iron clad and combat tested. Increase your defense by
1. You take 1 less damage from all damage types when in medium or heavy armor.

### C: Decapitation
Once each combat when you kill a foe, you may choose to decapitate them. All
other foes must save vs fear or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. If you kill a leader
or powerful foe, all other foes receive -1 on the save.


### D: Infamous Crest
You gain a sigil or crest, one feared and respected. Your name and sigil become
recognized and feared by nobility. You are recognized as formidable by other
knights, guards, and soldiers. You gain an additional attack against all foes
(this stacks with the additional attack against nobility gained by Bastard’s
Blood).

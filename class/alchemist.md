### A: Poison

All alchemists know how to make poison. No check needed. 
Some poisons have different effects, and most potions could be considered
poison. You know how to make one of the poisons below. 

| **d6**  | **Poison**
|  1. | shrink
|  2. | Pain
|  3. | Fear
|  4. | Frenzy
|  5. | Flatulence
|  6. | Coughing fit


### A: Field Brew 

Your knowledge allows you to brew without a dedicated labratory. 

You have one use of alchemist supplies per slot you buy (10g). 
Each is enough for one potion (the vial comes with the supplies).

### B: Explosives

Use some supplies to make a bomb. Only takes about 20 min. 
But careful, mishandle it and it might explode. 

When you set it off, don't be too close or you might get hurt. 
You could light a fuse, or just toss it as an attack. 

d6 damage per use of supplies, up to [template] dice. Its very loud. 
If you attack with it, a crit-fail and it explodes in your face. 

### C: Mutations

What alchemist doesn't like to experiment. Once a day, you can spend 1 hour
experementing on a creature by using the supplies for one potion. A random
mutation is applied to the creature. 

Roll a intelegence check to apply the last mutation result to another specimin. 
A failure results in a random one as normal. 

### D: Reverse Engineer

If you find a random potion, using an alchemist's labratory,
you can learn how to reverse engineer the potion
to find it's recipie. This requires a mind check, and consumes the potion in
the process.

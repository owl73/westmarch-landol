### A: Field Brew 

Your knowledge allows you to brew without a dedicated laboratory. 

You have one use of alchemist supplies per slot you buy (15g). 
Each is enough for one potion (the vial comes with the supplies).

### A: Poison

All alchemists know how to make poison. No check needed. Making poisons
requires alchemical supplies just like a potion. 
Some poisons have different effects, and most potions could be considered
poison. You know how to make one of the poisons below. 

| **d6**  | **Poison**
|  1. | shrink
|  2. | Pain
|  3. | Fear
|  4. | Frenzy
|  5. | Flatulence
|  6. | Coughing fit


### B: Explosives

Use some supplies to make a bomb. Only takes about 20 min. 
But careful, mishandle it and it might explode. 

When you set it off, don't be too close or you might get hurt. 
You could light a fuse, or just toss it as an attack. 

d6 damage per use of supplies, up to [template] dice. Its very loud. 
If you attack with it, a crit-fail and it explodes in your face. 

### C: Mutations

What alchemist doesn't like to experiment. Once a day, you can spend 1 hour
experimenting on a creature by using the supplies for one potion. A random
mutation is applied to the creature. 

Roll a intelligence check to apply the last mutation result to another specimen. 
A failure results in a random one as normal. 

### C: Dilute

You can take a potion and dilute it into two, this consumes an alchemist
supply and cannot be done again to the resulting potions.

### D: Reverse Engineer

If you find a random potion, using an alchemist's labratory,
you can learn how to reverse engineer the potion
to find it's recipie. This requires a mind check, and consumes the potion in
the process.

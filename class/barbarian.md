# Barbarian

**Starting Equipment:** heavy weapon, leather armour.

**Starting Skill:** Foreign Parts. Also, roll on adjacent table.

- **A:** Rage
- **B:** Danger Sense, A Taste of Home
- **C:** Feat of Strength, Die Hard
- **D:** Tough

You gain +2 HP for each Barbarian template you possess. You
get +1 Stealth if you possess 2 or more Barbarian templates.

#### A: Rage

You can choose to enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in
response to taking damage. You might froth, or stare in battle-
focus, or merely let a facade drop and give in to your ancient
urges, brutal warrior training, or religious fanaticism.
While in a rage:

- You gain +4 to Wisdom for Initiative purposes. You act before all other PCs in a round.
- You gain +1 attack per round.
- All your melee attacks inflict +1 damage.
- You can only cast damaging spells. All your spells deal +2 damage (if single target) or +1 damage (if multiple targets).
- You are immune to pain and fear.
- You cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things.

You cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or drive off all
enemies. If an ally has injured you this fight, they count as an
enemy. To stop raging, Save at the start of your turn.

#### B: Danger Sense

If you are surprised, you have a 50% chance to act in the
surprise round anyway. If you encounter a creature no one in the
group has seen before, you can roll under Intelligence to
remember a detail or weakness, provided the creature is not
unique.

#### B: A Taste of Home

You can consume a special ration to regain 1d6+1 HP. This
takes 1 round. Roll on the Table of Barbarian Delicacies. One
“dose” costs 1gp and can be purchased in any trading city. 3
doses fit in a single inventory slot. You cannot eat while raging,
but you can immediately enter a rage after eating the ration. If
you have any Lethal Damage, you instead heal to 0 HP. If an ally
waves the ration under you nose, you can roll under Constitution
to wake up.

#### C: Feat of Strength

Once per day, you have 22 Strength for 1 round. Your Strength
bonus is +4.

#### C: Die Hard

You have 4 rounds instead of 3 to remove all your Fatal Wounds.

#### D: Tough

Reduce all incoming damage by 1 point. Gain +2 to Save vs.
Mind Altering Effects.

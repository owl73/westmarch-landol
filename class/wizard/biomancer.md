# Biomancer

**Starting Equipment:** spellbook, ink and quill, 2 black thumb rings,
and 3 random potions (same type).

Biomancy is forbidden. The Authorityâ€™s law is clear; mortals were
meant to live for a time, age, and die. Flesh is temptation and
corruption. Biomancers revel in the flesh, seeking power and
immortality by adjusting their physical forms. Some masquerade
as physicians, philosophers, or wizards of other schools.

##### Perk
When you drink a potion, you have a 50% chance to recycle it
via whatever orifice you prefer. You have 10 minutes to excrete
the potion.
##### Drawback
Whenever you receive magical healing (except for the
regeneration spell), Save. If you fail, gain a random mutation.
##### Cantrips

1. Transfer a blemish or cosmetic feature from one creature to another. E.g. swap eye colours, warts from a toad to a princess.  You cannot transfer major features (poison, wings, etc.)
2. Taste blood to tell what kind of creature it came from.
3. If you wish, your appearance will no longer age. This may fail in times of dire stress.

### Mishaps

1 | MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24hrs.
2 | Take 1d6 damage.
3 | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save with a -4 penalty. Permanent if you fail.
4 | Agony for 1d6 rounds.
5 | Ravenously hungry. Cannot cast spells or attack until you eat 1 ration.
6 | Slough skin. Takes 1d6 rounds to remove. Disgusting.

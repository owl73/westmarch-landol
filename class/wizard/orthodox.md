# Orhthodox

**Starting Equipment:** spellbook, ink and quill, dagger, red robes.

Orthodox wizards are chartered, historic, and sensible wizards.
Their colleges only accept male students, but in small struggling
colleges, anyone with a false beard and a sack of gold will do.
It’s an open and widely mocked secret. Orthodox wizards study
all fields of magic, test theories, explore tombs, and fight in wars.
Their red robes are famous; to many peasants, a wizard without
red robes isn’t a wizard at all.

## Spells


#### 1. Lock

R: 50' T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 10 minutes

Non-living object closes and becomes locked. If the object is a door, chest, or
similar object, it will slam shut, dealing [sum] damage to any creature passing
through it and then trapping them. This spell works on things that aren't
technically portals (lock a sword in its scabbard, etc.). Requires Str
10+[dice]x4
to open. Alternatively, this spell can be cast on a creature's ori�ce. The
creature
gets a Save to resist, and another Save at the end of each of its turns.

#### 2. Knock

R: 50' T: [dice] objects D: 0

Object is opened. Doors are flung wide, locks are broken, shackles are bent
open, belts come undone. Treat this as a Strength check made with Str 10 +
[dice]x4. If target is an armoured creature, Save or armour falls off. If
target is an
unarmoured creature, Save or vomit for 1d4 rounds.

#### 3. Grease

R: 50' T: object, surface D: [dice]x2 rounds

Can be cast directly on a creature or a 10' x 10' x [dice] surface. All
creatures
affected must Save vs Dex or drop held objects, or, if moving, drop prone.

#### 4. Force Field

R: 10' T: plane or sphere D: concentration

Creates a shimmering force field, 10‘x10’, centered up to 10' away.
Alternatively,
create a sphere centered on the caster 5' in diameter (large enough for the
caster and +1 person). The force field has [sum] HP. All attacks against it hit.

#### 5. Levitate

R: 50' T: creature object D: concentration

You will an object to raise, lower, or hover. You cannot move the object
horizontally, and you cannot move it more than 10' per turn. Maximum weight is
[dice]x500 lbs. Lasts as long as you concentrate, but you take 1d6 psychic
damage per round after [dice]x3 rounds.

#### 6. Magic Missile

R: 200' T: creature D: 0

Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no Save. As an Orthodox Wizard, your spell
is unique to you and can be any shape, colour, and pattern your describe.

#### 7. Feather Fall

R: 10’ T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 0I

f you would take fall damage, you can cast this spell as a reaction to negate
it.
You �oat gently to the ground (possibly alarmingly late).

#### 8. Sleep

R: 50' T: creature D: 10 min

R: 50' T: [sum] HD of creatures D: 10 min / permanent

Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less
vigorous than a slap. Save negates. Non-alert, unaware targets do not get a
Save. If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes
permanent (until slapped) and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink
while
sleeping. If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration
becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the
creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)

#### 9. Light

R: touch T: object or creature D: [dice]x2 hours

Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively,
you
can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the
creature
is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature is
permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4
[dice]
or more this light has all the qualities of natural sunlight. Alternatively, if
you
invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest octarine, although it will only
last
for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely dangerous.

#### 10. Wizard Vision

R: touch T: sighted creature D: 10 min / permanent

If you invest one [die]: Target can see invisible things. Target can see
through
illusions. Non-magical disguises are not penetrated.
If you invest two or more [dice]: This can only be cast on yourself. As above,
except you can also see through magical darkness, and see the true forms of
shapeshifters. There are also some permanent effects: (a) You can forever see
invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of light. You know “there's
something over there” and what size it roughly is, but nothing else. (b) You
can
tell if someone else is a spellcaster by looking them in the eyes.
The price for this gift is your mind. You suffer a permanent loss of 1d6 Wisdom
(as you reject the true nature of Creation and go slightly mad) or 1d6 Charisma
(as you accept the true nature of Creation and alienate yourself from your
peers).

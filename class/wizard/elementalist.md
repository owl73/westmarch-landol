# Elementalist

**Starting Equipment:** spellbook, ink and quill, grey robes hemmed
in the colour of your elemental preference (or white if an
apprentice, black if an archmage or ambitious wizard).

Elementalist Wizards speak to and rely on elemental spirits.
They are a wild bunch, disreputable and windblown, but trained
in formal colleges and fully integrated into society. In rural areas,
they are beloved as rain-bringers and flood-calmers, but they are
also run out of town or hung following forest fires and
earthquakes. This is not always ignorant superstition. Attracting
the attention of powerful elemental spirits is very dangerous.
The elements are acid, air, fire, ice, lightning, stone, and water.
##### Perk
Reduce all incoming damage from a chosen elemental source
by 2. You can choose the element after rolling for spells, but you
cannot change it later.
##### Drawback
Increase all incoming damage from a chosen elemental source
by 2. You can choose the element after rolling for spells, but you
cannot change it later.
##### Cantrips

1. Meditate for 1 hour to gain Elemental Vision. Your training allows you to anthropomorphize elemental spirits. The ground appears to be made of interlinked stone bodies. A campfire is a jolly spirit devouring logs. Clouds appear as fat naked people rolling through the sky. You can speak to the spirits - you always could, anyone can - but when you are attuned like this, they are more inclined to listen. They won't obey you, and they may be hostile, but they may also offer advice, tell tales, demand offerings, or simply ignore you.
2. Summon a minor example of an element (a drop of acid, a puff of flame, a few flakes of ice, a spark, etc.). This cannot deal damage.
3. You know the current weather and the approximate weather for the next 2 days.

### Mishaps

1 | MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24hrs.
2 | Take 1d6 damage.
3 | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail.
4 | Inconvenienced based on the nature of the spell cast. Soaked, dehydrated, flung upwards, buried, etc.
5 | Deafened for 1d6 rounds.
6 | Wild elemental spirits flee your body for 1d6 rounds. Everyone who can see you must Save each round or be stunned.

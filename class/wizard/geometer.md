# Geometer

**Starting Equipment:** spellbook, ink and quill, protractor, ruler,
plumb line. You also have a magnetic compass and black robes
marked with white starcharts.

The procession of equinoxes, the rise and fall of constellations,
the movement of fixed and wandering stars; all fascinate the
Geometer. Some parts of the world seem to follow perfect
mathematical laws.This is not a coincidence because nothing is
ever a coincidence. Other parts are disordered, but perhaps
within the disorder there are hidden patterns and symmetries
waiting to be discovered.
##### Perk
If you are casting with sunlight on you, your MD return to your
pool on 1-4 (instead of 1-3).
##### Drawback
You cannot carry iron items. You must cast spells with a
magnetic compass in your hand. You can make a new compass
with 8 hours of effort and some basic tools.
##### Cantrips

1. Know the exact angle and distance to any point you can see.
2. Instantly count how many objects are in a pile.
3. Before your roll MD for a spell, declare “odds” or “evens”. If the [sum] rolled matches your prediction, heal 1 HP or increase the damage dealt by the spell by 1.

### Mishaps

1 | MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24hrs.
2 | Take 1d6 damage.
3 | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail.
4 | Blind for 1d6 rounds.
5 | Can only move limbs at right angles for 1d6 rounds. -8 to Attack and Defense. -4 to Dexterity and Movement.
6 | Spell targets you (if harmful) or an enemy (if helpful) or fizzles (if neutral).

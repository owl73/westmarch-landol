# Necromancer

**Starting Equipment:** spellbook, ink and quill, dagger, ritual
ingredient (1 slot). You may �ll as many inventory slots as you’d
like with corpse fragments (bones, dried �esh, etc.).

Necromancers are outlawed and outcast wizards. Their
profession is a curse; their very name a byword for unholy acts
and blasphemous deeds. Yet necromancers persist on the
fringes of society, doing necessary blasphemies.
##### Perk
You can cause creatures you touch to reroll any Fatal Wounds
they are trying to remove. You can do this in addition to providing
First Aid. You can force them to reroll successful or reroll failed
tests. If a creature successfully removes a Fatal Wound because
of a reroll you provided, they permanently lose 1 HP.
##### Drawback
You require a ritual ingredient (salt, herbs, etc.) to cast your
spells. The ingredient costs 2cp and is not consumed, but �re,
water, or isolation could render you unable to cast spells.
##### Cantrips

1. Target reasonably fresh corpse of a creature 2 HD or less answers 3 questions posed by the caster. The corpse can lie.
2. You can ritually protect a corpse against possession by wandering spirits, or deliberately invite them to possess a corpse. The ritual takes 10 minutes. The most dangerous time is between death and dawn.
3. You can permanently lose 1 HP to add 1 MD to a spell. You can only lose 1 HP per spell.

### Mishaps

1 | MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24hrs.
2 | Take 1d6 damage.
3 | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail.
4 | Save vs Fear against the target of your spell. Target is fully healed if undead, but is no longer under your control (if it ever was).
5 | 1d6 nearby corpses rise as zombies and attack you for 1d6 rounds.
6 | Your soul leaves your body. Roll Intelligence each hour to find your way back.

# Animist 

**Starting Equipment:** dagger, spellbook, ink and quill. You dress for concealment.

Animist Wizards are also known as witches. These are the bad
wizards, the ones who live in shacks on the edge of town or
castles on the edge of reality. They are the cursed ones, robed
in black, who you seek when all other hopes fail. When the
Church turns its back on you, when you scream curses into the
night, when your very soul burns, then you are in need of an
Animist Wizard... or ready to become one.

##### Perk
If someone makes a bargain with you and breaks it, Save. If you
pass, you instantly know they have broken the bargain. Your
spells can target parasites and unborn children without targeting
their hosts.
##### Drawback
You cannot bathe. You cannot return another person’s love.

##### Cantrips

1. Transform into an oily formless creature with your face that has either a) a fly speed of 2x Movement, b) 3x Movement, c) a swim speed of 2x Movement, d) a burrow speed of Movement, e) the ability to squeeze through gaps smaller than a human head.
2. Dim or extinguish all non-magical light sources in a 20’ radius.
3. Touch someone to learn if they have killed another sentient creature in the last 24hrs.

### Mishaps

1 | MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24hrs.
2 | Take 1d6 damage.
3 | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail.  Resembles your transformation.
4 | Blind for 1d6 rounds.
5 | Deafened for 1d6 rounds.
6 | Spell targets you (if harmful) or enemy (if beneficial) or fizzles (if neutral).

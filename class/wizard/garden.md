# Garden 

**Starting Equipment:** spellbook, ink and quill, quarterstaff, spade,
brown robes, and a good pair of leather boots.

Everyone's favourite kind of wizard. If you live in a feudal society
where crop failure can result in total existence failure, having
someone around who can talk to plants, move trees, and get
crops to grow is incredibly valuable. Nobles sponsor them; up-
and-coming merchants and landowners want to marry them.
Peasants leave them gifts and come to them with all sorts of
problems. Alone, among wizards, they are beloved.
Except by druids. The garden is the antithesis of the forest.
Gardens are shrines to domesticated plants. A big wheat field is
impressive, but a garden is a tiny segment of the wilderness
made perfect and smooth. Dogs are tamed wolves. Gardens are
tamed forests. We tell stories about how real life ought to be,
and we build gardens to make nature the way it ought to be.
##### Perk
You gain +1 to Attack and Defense while wielding a quarterstaff.
##### Drawback
To regain magic dice, you must meditate for 10 minutes each
morning within sight of natural beauty. Even some mold growing
on a rock counts. You must describe this to other players.
##### Cantrips

1. Permanently change the colour or form of a small plant.
2. Plants grow just a little bit better in a [level] mile radius around you. It takes at least a season to be noticeable.
3. You can sleep anywhere, in any position, with a few moments notice. You can set environmental conditions that will wake you, such as “sunrise” or “rain”.

### Mishaps

1 | MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24hrs.
2 | Take 1d6 damage.
3 | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail.
4 | Plants wither in a 5xd20’ radius around you.
5 | Save vs Fear against fire for the next 24hrs.
6 | Plants erupt from your fingers and toes. Everyone in a 50’ radius must roll
under Dexterity or be entangled and slowed. The plants fade in 1 hour.ooms

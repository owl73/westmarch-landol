# White Hand

**Starting Equipment:** spellbook, ink and quill, grey robes with a
white circle on them.

Wizards of the White Hand are a chartered order imported from
Foreign Parts. They are not numerous but their feats are
legendary. They are seen as the kindest of all wizard schools,
mostly due to propaganda efforts and feats in battle. Some
White Hand Wizards tattoo white circles on their foreheads.
##### Perk
Any spell with a range of “Touch” can be cast on a target you
have previously touched, up to 10 miles per wizard template.
##### Drawback
You cannot eat meat. You must wear a white circle on your
robes or belt.
##### Cantrips

1. Press your hands together to count as Strength 20 against being pushed, shoved, or moved.
2. Spend 10 minutes running your hands over your clothing to remove any stains or dirt.
3. If an attack would reduce you from full HP to 0 HP or less, you may spend all your remaining MD to survive it with 1 HP. You must spend at least 1 MD.

### Mishaps

1 | MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24hrs.
2 | Take 1d6 damage.
3 | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail.
4 | Blind for 1d6 rounds.
5 | Deafened for 1d6 rounds.
6 | Spell targets you (if harmful) or enemy (if beneficial) or fizzles (if neutral).

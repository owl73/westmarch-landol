# Illusionist 

**Starting Equipment:** spellbook, ink and quill, rainbow-coloured
gloves.

Illusionists study light, mirrors, and the nature of truth. Their
school is a dangerous one; the Mirror Realms are perilous.
Illusionists are light-magicians. They are a recently revived
school. Their theories on light and optics are considered radical
by most and utter nonsense by the peasantry. Illusionists have
invented many speculative and outright false theories to explain
their magic. For every gaudy show-wizard travelling between
villages to earn a living, there is an obsessive wizard living in a
mirror-lined tower, probing the secrets of Creation.

##### Perk

Your Illusions spells can be maintained by concentration. If you
break concentration, they expire at the end of their duration.

##### Drawback

You cannot cast spells unless you can see all 7 colours. Your
magic provides the 8th: octarine.

##### Cantrips

1. Create a shower of illusory sparks or a puff of illusory smoke from your hands.
2. Touch another caster’s illusion and make an opposed Intelligence test. If you succeed, you gain control of their illusion.
3. You always know the position of the sun in the sky.

### Mishaps

1d6 | Mishaps
1 | MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24hrs.
2 | Take 1d6 damage.
3 | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail.
4 | Blind for 1d6 rounds.
5 | All sighted creatures are invisible to you for 24 hours.
6 | Eruption of illusions from your hands. Everyone who can see you must Save to do anything relying on sight for 1d6 rounds.

### Dooms 

| Dooms |
| 1 | A 10’ square mirror appears and you are compelled to enter. You lose a random item, gain a random item of approximately equal value, and have 0 HP. You return the next morning, shivering and afraid.
| 2 | You turn into an illusion for a day. You can make no sound and cannot be felt. Solid impacts pop you. You lose 1d6 permanent HP and reform the next day.
| 3 | You turn into an illusion permanently.

## Spells

#### 1. Illusion

R: 50' T: [dice]x5' diameter D: 1 minute

You create an illusion of whatever object or creature you want. It can move at
your will, but cannot make any sound or smell. Illusions can only add, not
subtract. They can cover up a hole, but not create the illusion of a hole. At 1
[dice] you can create a 6’ tall illusory humanoid.

#### 2. Disguise

R: touch T: object D: [dice] hours

You cloak the object in illusion, making it appear as another object of the
same
type. An apple could be disguised as any other type of fruit; a table could be
disguised as any other type of furniture. A humanoid can be disguised as any
other humanoid of comparable size. This only extends to the visual properties
of
the object. The maximum size of the object depends on how many dice are
invested in the spell: 1 [dice]: human-sized, 2 [dice]: ogre- or wagon-sized, 3 [dice]: dragon- or tavern-sized, 4 [dice]: ship- or bridge-sized.

#### 3. Prismatic Ray

R: 200' T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 0

Target suffers a different effect depending on which color strikes the target.
Roll
1d10: 1. Red. Target takes [sum] fire damage, Save for half. 2. Orange. Target
takes [sum] bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. Save negates. 3.
Yellow. Target takes [sum] lightning damage, Save for half. 4. Green. Target
takes [sum] acid damage, Save for half. 5. Blue. Target takes [sum] ice damage,
Save for half. 6. Purple. Target takes [sum] necrotic damage and is blinded for
[sum] rounds. Save negates. 7, 8, 9. Struck twice. Roll a d6 twice. Add
effects;
make one save. 10. Struck thrice. Roll a d6 three times.

#### 4. Mirror Image

R: 0 T: self D: 10 minutes

You create 1d4+[dice] illusory images of yourself, which move as you move and
always stay within 5' of you. They are constantly stepping through each other,
so
that it is impossible to tell which is which. When an enemy attacks you, roll
to see
if they hit you or an image. An image vanishes as soon as it suffers a solid
impact. Area effects such as a dragon's breath will cause all images to vanish.

#### 5. Mirror Object

R: touch T: mirror D: [dice] hours

You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out a copy of an object adjacent
to
the mirror. The object that you pull out must be within reach of the mirror (as
if it
were a window), small enough to fit through the mirror (as if it were a window)
and light enough for you to pull through with one hand. The mirror object looks
and feels exactly like the object it copied. It doesn't copy any magical
properties
of the object. You cannot duplicate living things in this way. The mirror
object
pops like a bubble if it suffers a solid blow. If you invest at least 4 [dice]
into this
spell, it can copy the magical properties of an item, but those magical
properties
will only function once. For items with continuous properties, such as a flying
carpet, the magic properties will last no longer than 10 minutes.

#### 6. Light


R: touch T: object or creature D: [dice]x2 hours

Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively,
you
can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the
creature
is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature is
permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4
[dice]
or more this light has all the qualities of natural sunlight. Alternatively, if
you
invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest octarine, although it will only
last
for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely dangerous.

#### 7. Hypnotic Orb

R: touch T: object D: [sum] minutes

You enchant a mostly-spherical object so that it's surface is covered with a
captivating, shimmering pattern. Any creature who sees the enchanted object
must Save or be compelled to sit still and observe it for the spell's duration.
Flying creatures will land or circle it. The caster is not immune to this
effect. The
effect is broken if line of sight is broken, if something startles a target (a
loud
adjacent shout), or if the target see signs of obvious danger (such as someone
killing their friends).

#### 8. Colour Spray

R: [dice]x10' cone T: sighted creatures D: 0 / varies

If [sum] is equal or greater to the creature's HD, it is befuddled for 1d6
rounds. If
[sum] is three times the creature's HD or more, it is stunned for a round, then
befuddled for 1d6 rounds. If [sum] is five times the creature's HD, it is
stunned for
1d6 rounds, then befuddled for 1d6 rounds.

#### 9. Wizard Vision

R: touch T: sighted creature D: 10 min / permanent

If you invest one [die]: Target can see invisible things. Target can see
through
illusions. Non-magical disguises are not penetrated.
If you invest two or more [dice]: This can only be cast on yourself. As above,
except you can also see through magical darkness, and see the true forms of
shapeshifters. There are also some permanent effects: (a) You can forever see
invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of light. You know “there's
something over there” and what size it roughly is, but nothing else. (b) You
can
tell if someone else is a spellcaster by looking them in the eyes.
The price for this gift is your mind. You suffer a permanent loss of 1d6 Wisdom
(as you reject the true nature of Creation and go slightly mad) or 1d6 Charisma
(as you accept the true nature of Creation and alienate yourself from your
peers).

#### 10. Wall of Light

R: 50' T: wall or sphere D: 10 min

You conjure either (a) a hemisphere [dice]x5’ in diameter, or (b) a 10' by 10'
panel per [dice], which can be arranged in any contiguous formation joined by
their edges. The wall is intangible, but you can control what each side shows.
It
can be either (a) inky darkness, (b) light out to 30', (c) mirror, (d)
transparency, or
(e) a simple texture, such as stone, brick, or carpet. Both sides do not have
to
show the same thing. You can change these surfaces with a thought. If you
invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, you may make the duration permanent.

#### 11. Mirror Self

R: touch T: mirror D: 10 minutes

You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out [dice] copies of yourself.
The
mirror must be large enough for you to pass through. Your mirror clones behave
as you wish. They can walk and talk, but it cannot pick anything up. You can
see
through their eyes and hear through its ears. You can cast spells through them.
You can switch places with your mirror twin as a free action. A mirror twin
pops
like a bubble if it suffers a solid blow.

#### 12. Fade

R: 50' T: creature or object D: [sum] rounds

Target phases out and becomes unable to affect the world in any way except
visually. It stands or floats like an illusion until the spell concludes. Not
even
magic can affect the target. If they would be in a solid object when the spell
expires, they are harmlessly shunted into the nearest open space. The maximum
size of the object depends on how many dice are invested in the spell: 1 [dice]:
human-sized, 2 [dice]: ogre- or wagon-sized, 3 [dice]: dragon- or tavern-sized, [dice]: ship- or bridge-sized.

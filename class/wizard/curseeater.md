# Curse-Eater

**Starting Equipment:** spellbook, ink and quill. Both your smallest

fingers or one eye are missing (and devoured).
The line between a curse and an enchantment is almost
invisible. Curse-Eaters are wizards who specialize in personal
and forbidden magic. They are widely reviled by the Church and
by other wizards, for their powers inevitably corrupt and twist the
spells of others.

##### Perk

You can take 1 MD from an adjacent wizard’s pool and add it to
your spell. They know you have done this. On a 1-3, the MD
returns to their pool (as normal). If the MD does not return, you
can choose to either heal the wizard for 1d6 HP or in�ict 1d6
magic damage.

##### Drawback

Barring exceptional circumstances, you cannot enter a good
afterlife. Domesticated animals fear you.

##### Cantrips

1. Touch a creature or object to discover if it is cursed (i.e. if it has a negative but hidden magical effect applied to it). You can roll under Intelligence to divine the nature of the curse.
2. Touch a recently deceased person, perform a 10 minute ritual, and Save. If you pass, you take all their sins upon yourself. They arrive in the afterlife with only their positive deeds remembered.
3. Spit to crack all non-magical mirrors within 50’. Calm water will ripple. Other re�ective surfaces may crack or darken.

### Mishaps

1 | MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24hrs.
2 | Take 1d6 damage.
3 | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail.
4 | Blind for 1d6 rounds.
5 | Agony for 1d6 rounds.
6 | Spell targets ally (if harmful) or enemy (if bene�cial) or �zzles (if neutral).

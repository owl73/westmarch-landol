### Spellcasting

Spells are living creatures. Spells, enchantments, ghosts, and
souls are all more or less the same. A wizard's spells range in
intelligence from pond scum to ferrets. A spellbook is a
menagerie-prison. A well-trained brain is a mind-gun loaded with
spell-bullets. Minor spells, called cantrips, infest a wizard's soul
and bind to it. 

It takes 1hr to move any number of spells between
a spell slot in your brain and a spellbook, scroll, or wand.
To cast a spell, select a number of Magic Dice (MD) you wish to
invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. As a Wizard,
you get +1 MD per Wizard template. Most spells depend on the
number of [dice] invested and the [sum] they show. Doubles
generate Mishaps; triples generate Dooms. Casting a spell from
a scroll provides +1 MD as the scroll burns.

Dice that roll 1-3 return to your casting pool and can be used
again that day. Dice that roll 4-6 are removed from your casting
pool for the day. Your spells return at sunrise to last location they
were imprisoned, when the octarine light of the sun touches the
world and infuses Creation with an extra boost of raw magic.
Your MD return if you get a good night's sleep. If you didn't sleep
well, you can Save for each MD to have them return to your pool
anyway.

When you gain Template A, roll 2 d6s and gain the spells listed.
Template B, roll 1d8. Template C, roll 1d10. Template D, choose
4 spells from the list. If a duplicate spell is rollled, you may
choose to keep it or reroll.

You can try to bodge together a spell-like effect appropriate to
your school by pouring any number of MD into a target and
hoping for the best. Effects are adjudicated by the GM, but are
usually haphazard and dangerous. Mishaps and Dooms apply.
You can detect strong ambient magic if you are not distracted. To
learn details about spells or magic items, roll under Intelligence.

#### B: Book Casting

You can cast from a scroll or a spellbook in a way that does not
consume the scroll. This allows you to cast directly from your
spellbook without loading the spell into your brain first. You do
not gain the bonus MD that consuming a scroll generates. You
must declare you are casting a spell from a book before
initiatives are rolled for the turn.You automatically go last in the
initiative round, and you automatically fumble the spell if you
take any damage during the round. The spell vanishes from the
scroll or book and returns the next morning.

#### C: Friendly Spell

Apply a random mutation to a spell you frequently cast.

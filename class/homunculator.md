#### A: Homunculus
You have an obedient servant. You made it from a newborn bear. It is, in a
way, your child. It is as intelligent as a well-trained dog.

A default Homonculus has 10 in all stats, 10 HP, and is the size of a person.
They make 1 melee attack per round and deal 1d6 damage on a hit. Gifts and
Curses of Flesh can alter these stats. They do not need to test Morale. A
Homonculus is a hireling that thinks you're a mother-god.

Non-magic damage cannot kill a Homunculus. Making cancer obedient is easy when
it knows nothing but obedience from birth. Vital organs are not required when
any cell can perform any function. Any damage beyond 0 (negative HP) instead
incapacitates a Homunculus for that many hours. Acid, fire, magic, or being
spread over a square mile will kill a Homunculus permanently. Creating a new
one takes 3 weeks, 500gp in components, and access to an area where bears are
likely to be found.

Homunculi still need to eat (and heal as a normal PC), sleep, and breathe.
They are not proficient with weapons, have no inventory slots (but can
temporarily carry up to 10 slots of items if carefully supervised), and will
try to remove clothes and armour.

Injecting the vital extracts (blood or spinal fluid are traditional) of a
creature into a homunculus grants it temporary powers, typically for 1 hour.
Roll on a Monster Menu-All table, bearing in mind that negative effects only
last 1 hour. Injecting 2 or more things (or injecting something very powerful)
requires the Homunculus to Save or become torpid for 1d6 hours. On a critical
failure, it dies instead. It uses your Save. You can take 1d12 damage to let
the Homunculus reroll a failed Save.

#### C: Shared Senses
You share senses with your Homunculus. This ability has a 500' range.

#### C: Regeneration
Instead of healing like a PC, a Homunculus heals 1 HP every 10 minutes. If you
are touching your Homunculus, you can transfer 1 HP from it to you per round.

1d20 | Curses of Flesh
1 | Timid. In dangerous or novel situations, the  Homunculus must test Morale to leave your sight for more than a few minutes.
2 | Fragile. If the Homunculus takes 3 or more damage in a round, it must Save or spend the next round writhing in agony.
3 | Wrong Scent. Animals fear the Homunculus. Small creatures flee, dogs bark, horses shy, and larger creatures target the Homunculus with furious hostility.
4 | Territorial. If ordered to attack, the Homunculus must test Morale to attack anything but the largest and most dangerous target. Does not appreciate close contact with your friends or allies.
5 | Easily Bored. If inactive, will knock things over, swat people, or make alarming noises.
6 | Auorovore. Every time the party obtains treasure worth more than 10gp, at least 5% of the total (or 25% of your share, whichever is easiest) must be given to the Homunculus to hoard and devour.
7 | Treacherous. During non-adventuring times (at night, in town, etc.), the Homunculus sneaks off to commit crimes, devour livestock, or terrorize travelers.
8 | Truly Hideous. If visible, minimum of a -4 penalty to reaction rolls.  Other hirelings have a -2 penalty to Morale. Face not even a mother-god could love.
9 | Lazy. Unless threatened (by you or by an enemy), the Homunculus takes 1 round to start to do anything urgent, or 10 minutes to start to do anything non-urgent.
10 | Umbilicus. You are connected to your Homunculus by a 20' flesh cord.  You can sever it, but while separated your and your Homunculus' maximum HP is reduced by 4. You must reattach the cord to sleep.
11 | Molting. Once per week, the Homunculus must spend 6 hours shedding and regrowing its skin in a truly disgusting and noisy process. It consumes 3 rations immediately after molting.
12 | Superstitious. The Homunculus must test Morale or cower when a holy symbol is visible.
13 | Carnivorous. The Homunculus must eat fresh raw meat as rations.
14 | Slime Trail. Leaves behind a slightly sticky trail of mucus.
15 | Light-Fearing. The Homunculus has a -4 penalty to Attack and Save in bright sunlight.
16 | Full Reformation. If reduced below 0 HP or killed, covers a 30' radius in acidic sludge, dealing 1d6 acid damage per round to anything in the area.  Effect lasts until the Homunculus reforms.
17 | Fire-Fear. Must test Morale to remain within 30' of a torch-sized fire or larger. Lanterns, matches, and candles are eyed with distrust.
18 | Growing Distrust. The Homunculus knows what it is and knows it is being used. It may disobey suicidal commands, plot to replace you, or try to gain power on its own.
19 | Disease-Bearing. Automatically fails all Saves against disease. Does not suffer any negative effects from diseases, but is contagious.
20 | Tumorous. Any attack that deals 2 or more damage to the Homonculus knocks off disgusting lumps of flesh, blood, and ichor. No mechanical effect
but it's extremely gross.

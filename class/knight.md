# Knight

**Starting Equipment:** chainmail, shield, sword, horse, 5sp.

**Starting Skill:** Courtesy. Also, roll on adjacent table.

- **A:** Challenge, Champion
- **B:** Bodyguard
- **C:** Dragon Slayer, Parry
- **D:** Aura of Courage, Inspire

You gain +2 to Save vs Fear for each Knight template you
possess.

#### A: Challenge

This ability only works on creatures that can understand you and
are capable of being offended. If you challenge a creature
outside combat, they must Save or accept your challenge. In
civilized areas, this could mean a duel, a joust, or a brawl. The
challenged party can set conditions for the duel. Leaders may
send out champions.

In combat, you can challenge one creature each turn as a free
action. The creature must Save. If they fail they must attack you.
This ability cannot force an enemy to make major tactical errors.

#### A: Champion

After all enemies have completed their turns in a combat round,
select one enemy that only targeted you with attacks, and that
you targeted with your attack. Make a second attack against that
enemy. Effectively, this gives you two attacks per round if you
are fighting an enemy one-on-one.

#### B: Bodyguard

Once per round, if an adjacent ally would take damage from a
physical attack, you may make an Attack roll. If you succeed,
you take the damage instead.

#### C: Dragon Slayer

Once per day, you may add +X damage to one of your physical
attacks, where X is the HD of the most powerful monster killed
by you or your party. Keep track of this. If you miss, this ability is
not expended.

#### C: Parry

Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points.
If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the
damage by 12 points instead of 1d12.

#### D: Aura of Courage

Allies who can see and hear you can use your Save vs Fear
instead of their own. This ability has no effect if you are currently
afraid.

#### D: Inspire

Once per day, allies who can see and hear you heal 1d4 HP. If
they were at full HP, they instead gain +2 to their next Attack roll.

## Backgrounds

| 1d3 | 1d6 | Knight Skills
| 1 | Farmer
| | 1 | You never attend formal court unless summoned. In high- pressure situations, you follow shiny and confident people.
| | 2 | 2d6 squabbling tenant families write you frequent letters asking for advice or informing on their treasonous neighbours.
| | 3 | Your armour is dented, your horse is used to the plough, and your sword is rusty. Other knights laugh at you... for now.
| | 4 | Your family is on the decline. Given half the chance, you’ll slip out of the Second Estate entirely.
| | 5 | You migrated here, invented a tale, and assumed the garb of a knight. Gain the “Foreign Parts” skill.
| | 6 | You are deeply pious (or pretend to be so). You pray to a patron saint, quote holy texts, and protect relics and churches.
| 2 | Soldier
| | 1 | To you, honour is everything. Maintaining your image as a chivalric paragon often clashes with the realities of life.
| | 2 | You love to fight. You read reports of battles and tournaments with glee. New weapons or fighting styles fill you with joy.
| | 3 | You distinguished yourself in several tournaments. Other nobles might recognize your heraldry or colours.
| | 4 | A famous ancestor distinguished themselves in battle. You are expected to do the same or die trying.
| | 5 | Your relatives continually write to you insisting you marry. They suggest alarming brides with alarming regularity.
| | 6 | You love brightly coloured silks, long pointed shoes, fancy hawks, and rare spices.
| 3 | Unusual (Gain the skill listed.)
| | 1 | You are the bastard son of a noble. You’ve fought in half a dozen wars to earn his attention. Gain the “Siege Warfare” skill.
| | 2 | Gain the “Foreign Parts” skill and a riding animal of an unusual breed (a six-legged horse, a camel, a giant centipede). Its is identical to a horse mechanically and too weird to sell.  Replacements cost 200gp.
| | 3 | You are the bastard son of a noble, and a real mean bastard too.  Gain the “Poison” skill and a small vial of deadly poison.
| | 4 | Your family is so large they more-or-less forgot about you. Gain the “History” skill.
| | 5 | You fight with an unusual weapon. Gain a heavy weapon (if Strength >12) or a dagger (if <12) and the “Horses” skill.

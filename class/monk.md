# Monk / Nun

**Starting Equipment:** robes, holy book.

**Starting Skill:** Religion. Also, roll on adjacent table.

- **A:** Literacy, Restrictions of your Order, Unarmed Strike
- **B:** Flighty, Stunning Fist
- **C:** Evasion, Pronouncement 
- **D:** Improved Dodge, Obscure Knowledge

You can read and write exceptionally well. Your letters allow for
Charisma tests at a distance. You can roll to see the intentions of
an author, the delicate themes of a poem, and inconsistencies in
a contract. To most people this is sorcery.

#### A: Restrictions of your Order
You can wear armour, but it takes up 2 additional Inventory
Slots. You are expected to avoid the use of violence and magic,
practice celibacy, and live righteously. Make up at least 2 other
behavioural restrictions. In practice, do what you want, as long
as you don’t get caught.
#### A: Unarmed Strike
You do not start with proficiency in any weapons, even daggers.
(You have -4 to Attack with a weapon until you gain proficiency
by landing 8 successful hits in combat.) On a successful Attack
roll you deal a maximum of 1 damage. If you gain a template in a
fighter-type class, this restriction no longer applies.
#### B: Flighty
If you choose to Act Defensively instead of attacking in a combat
round, you count as wearing plate armour (16 Defence).
#### B: Stunning Fist
If you hit a target with an attack on the first round of combat and
the target wasn’t expecting it, you deal normal damage
(1+Strength Bonus for a punch, 1d6+Strength Bonus for a
dagger, etc.). If the target had total trust in your non-violent
ways, they must also Save or be Stunned for 1 round.
#### C: Evasion
You can never be pinned in a corner by difficult topics or
arguments. You can always retreat to authority, throw up textual
obstacles, or deploy dogma. No one can make you admit
something in conversation that you did not intend to admit; any
accidental disclosures are retroactively fixed, if possible.
#### C: Pronouncement
You can speak for up to 3 hours without pause on a given topic.
No tests required. Peasants, nobles, and other sensible people
will hear you out politely, unless they've got something better to
do. Monsters will still devour you, dragons might argue with you.

#### D: Improved Dodge
Once per session, you can declare that an attack that hit you
missed you instead. This won’t save you from falls or landslides,
but traps will fail and spells will turn away.
#### D: Obscure Knowledge
Once per session, you can declare something is to be true
because you read it in a book. The base chance of the thing
actually being true is 50%.
There has to be a plausible way you
could know about it from reading books (new discoveries, minor
details, and personal secrets are unlikely). You don't know
whether or not it is true right away; the GM will roll when it
matters. You might only be partially correct, but you will never be
catastrophically wrong. If you have access to a library of 50
books, the base chance increases to 80%.

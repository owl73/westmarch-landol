#### A: Summoning

There are 99, and only 99, Entities that can be summoned. Each
has a name, a description, and a list of abilities.

To summon an Entity, select a number of Summoning Dice (SD)
you wish to invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. As a
Summoner, you get +1 SD per Summoner template. Some
effects depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum]
they show. Doubles generate Mishaps; triples generate Dooms.

Dice that roll 1-3 return to your summoning pool and can be
used again that day. Dice that roll 4-6 are removed from your
casting pool for the day. Entities are summoned for [sum] hours.
You can banish an Entity you have summoned at will, and
summon the same Entity multiple times per day (provided you
have SD left).

By default, Summons have 10 in all stats, 10 HP, are intelligent,
can speak and hear, and will obey the Summonerâ€™s commands.

When you gain Template A, roll 2 d100s and gain the Entities
listed. Template B and C, roll 1d100. Template D, choose one
Entity or roll 1d100. If a duplicate Entity is rolled, reroll.
You can try to end reality-warping or summon-type effects by
pouring any number of SD into a target and hoping for the best.
Effects are adjudicated by the GM, but are usually haphazard
and dangerous. Mishaps and Dooms apply.

You can detect the presence of summoned creatures or
unnatural effects if you are not distracted. To learn details about
the effect, roll under Intelligence.

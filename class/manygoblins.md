# Many goblins

Many Goblins act as one character. There are a lot of them
(though the exact amount seems to vary from scene to scene)
and they contribute about as much as one actual character (at
best). They are a bunch of goblins milling about in the back of
the scene, doing goblin things, kind of half-paying attention, and
mostly serving as colourful detail.

**Starting Equipment**: many daggers, �lthy rags, �eas, etc. Roll for
1 random item from the Table of Professions.

**Starting Skill**: goblan.

- **A**: Shared Totals
- **B**: +1 Goblin Warlord
- **C**: +1 Goblin Warlord, Use Thing
- **D**: +1 Goblin Warlord, New Thing

Many Goblins gain +2 HP every level. If this would take them
over 24 HP, they instead split into Two Many Goblins and lose
half their maximum HP. One half runs away.

#### A: Shared Totals

Many Goblins have a shared HP pool just like a normal
character. Every point of damage causes a single goblin to die in
an inconsequential background sort of way. Area of affect
attacks and traps only affect them once. Single-target Save or
Die effects instead cause Many Goblins to lose 1 HP. Other
single-target spells usually affect all the goblins. Mutations might
affect all the goblins or become a Thing they can use (see Use
Thing below).

Somehow they consume the same ration as one person.

If Many Goblins are reduced to 0 HP, they become strewn about
the place, wounded and moaning, miserable and unable to help
anyone until healed. If they are reduced below 0 HP they all die
in a suitably tragic-comic fashion. The only survivors will be the
Goblin Warlords (see below).

Many Goblins have 5 inventory slots total. They can carry more
things but they will inevitably lose, smash, ruin, sell, or eat all but
5 items. Weapons and armour are carried separately and do not
occupy inventory slots. In order to gain any bene�t from a
weapon, armour set, or magic item, Many Goblins need 10
copies. Give them 10 swords and they deal sword damage, etc.
They spend money collectively and irresponsibly.

If you need to determine exactly how Many Goblins are present,
roll 1d12+6. This number varies encounter to encounter and
even round to round. When performing basic unskilled labour,
like digging a trench or carrying buckets, Many Goblins count as
10 people for the first hour, 5 people the next hour, and give up
after the third hour. They occupy an area 20' square whenever
possible, spreading as needed (a 5' wide 80' long line, etc.)

#### B: Goblin Warlord

One goblin in the swarm has earned a name. Once per
encounter, for one round, the named goblin can do something
different than the other Many Goblins. They could run to warn
the PCs while the rest of the Many Goblins fight something. At
the end of the round, the Goblin Warlord is absorbed back into
the swarm. Goblin Warlords get a name and a very short
description like, "has a horned helmet" or "smells of cheese."

If the Many Goblins die, each Goblin Warlord becomes a Level 1
Goblan with no bonuses, the stats of the Many Goblans, and 2
HP. If the Goblin Warlords find some more goblins, or spend
some time in an area where goblins are likely to be found, they
can recombine to form a new Level 2 Many Goblans. Only 1
Goblin Warlord survives this process. You can use orphans,
urchins, drunkards, wastrels, and particularly cunning feral dogs
to fill out the ranks. Goblinism is contagious.

#### C: Use Thing
Many Goblins can now be given magic items or special tools.
They can use them once per encounter, collectively. This could
be a Goblin Warlord action. The goblin with the magic wand �res
it, the goblin with the serrated weasel-thrower uses it, then steps
back into the crowd.
#### D: New Thing
Many Goblins gain a special 6th inventory slot that contains a
random item rolled on the Table of Professions. Roll the item
randomly each encounter. If the Many Goblins run into another
room or out of sight (one round at least) and then run back (a
second round) they can reroll the item.

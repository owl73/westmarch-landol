# Dropout Mage
Once an academic and talented magician, now a dropout of the local mages
college. He retains some of what he’s learned, if he can get the hand movements
right. Looking to pay off tuition debts, he seeks work in the real world
outside of the ivory tower.

**Starting Equipment:** Cloak, Short Sword, Leather Armor, Purse (contains 1d6x10
gold)

**Starting Skill:** Research, Deception

**Bonus:** Your charisma and intelligence become 10

**Restriction:** may not have more than one stat over 10 upon selection, you have a
debt of 500 gold

### A: Broken Magic Knowledge
You know some aspects of casting and were once promising to the academic mages;
however, you never got the hand movements down. If you roll a 1 on a die when
you cast a spell that spell mishaps and the MD is immediately lost. You have one
MD and know one spell per template of Dropout Mage.

### A: Spell Sword
You’ve taken a liking to following up your spells with the swing of a sword,
just incase one of those misses the mark. You may cast a spell and attack in
the same turn. You have no penalty for casting in Melee.

Level Goal: Convince a wizard to tutor you or obtain a second MD

### B: Quick Wits
You were never dumb, just lazy and seemingly less nimbleness with the wiggle of
the fingers. You may gain a useful bit of knowledge from the GM about a
historic, lore, or magical subject once each day.

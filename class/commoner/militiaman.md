# Militiaman

Drafted into service, crudely trained, but well equipped, a warm body to fill
the ranks.

**Starting Equipment:**
Gambeson, spear, crossbow, bolts

**Starting Skill:** 
Athletics

**Bonus:** you’ve got good conditioning, your strength and constitution 
become 10 

**Restriction:** may not have more than one stat over 10 upon selection.

### A: Basic Tactics
You’re taught two things, how to fight and how to survive, neither very well.
At the beginning of combat you may decide to get either +1 to damage or
defense.

### A: Brace
You are trained to brace against charging foes. When an enemy moves to engage
you  in melee combat, you may interrupt their movement to get a free attack
before they attack you.

### B: Bandage
You are trained in basic first aid. You know how to stop bleeding and can apply
a bandage to a wound. You and your comrades heal 1 additional HP when taking a
rest. This does not stack with multiple Militiaman, but could stack with other
similar abilities of other classes.
